# Phase 9 Playtest Calibration Report

Generated by `scripts/tools/phase9_playtest_report.js`.

Method: mission-level heuristic simulation using current `missions.json`, `enemy_templates.json`, `cards.json`, and runtime enemy scaling logic mirrored from `CardManager.get_mission_enemies()`.

## Baseline Player Model (Starter Deck)
- Estimated player damage/turn: **10.56**
- Estimated mitigation/turn: **2.54**
- Estimated healing/turn: **0.69**

## Tuning Recommendations
- Target predicted win rates:
  - Act 1: 72-82%
  - Act 2: 60-75%
  - Act 3: 45-65%
- If a mission is too easy (<3 turns to win): increase HP before damage.
- If a mission is too punishing (<2.4 turns to lose): reduce enemy damage before armor.
- Re-run this report after each tuning pass.
