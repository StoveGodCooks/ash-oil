## ⚠️ GAPS IN CURRENT RESEARCH (What You Need to Add)

### 1. SLAVERY SYSTEM & MANUMISSION (CRITICAL GAP)

**Why You Need This:** Your story is about a slave fighting for freedom, but your research doesn't explain HOW slavery or freedom actually worked in Rome.

**Missing Topics:**
- **Legal status of slaves (servus vs. libertus vs. civis)**
  - What rights did slaves have (or not have)?
  - What was the legal process for manumission (freeing a slave)?
  - What happened AFTER freedom was granted? (Still stigmatized as libertus)
  
- **Types of manumission in Roman law:**
  - Manumissio vindicta (by rod, in front of magistrate)
  - Manumissio censu (by census registration)
  - Manumissio testamento (by will)
  - Informal manumission (less legal weight)
  - **Specific to gladiators: The rudis** - How did this differ from other forms?

- **Post-freedom status:**
  - Freedmen (liberti) were still infames in some contexts
  - Social stigma and limitations
  - Patron obligations (former master still had claims on freedman)
  - Could freedmen become citizens? Own property? Vote?

- **Gladiator-specific freedom:**
  - How many fights to earn rudis? (If there was a number)
  - Could lanista refuse to grant freedom?

## 🎯 PRIORITY RESEARCH ORDER (What to Add First)

If you only have time for limited additional research, prioritize in this order:

### HIGH PRIORITY (Essential for Story):
1. **Slavery & Manumission** - Core to your "fight for freedom" theme
2. **Spartacus Rebellion Details** - Should be legendary in your story
3. **Arena Spectacle Structure** - Needed to write authentic mission scenes
4. **Roman Religion & Mystery Cults** - Essential for SPECTER faction and story depth

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enriches Story):
5. **Social Hierarchy & Patronage** - Needed for political conspiracy plot
6. **Women in Roman Society** - Context for female gladiator lieutenants
7. **Crime & Punishment** - Context for condemned criminal characters
8. **Military Context** - Important for AEGIS faction and ex-soldier characters

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have):
9. **Provincial Arenas** - Mainly for Season 2 expansion hooks
10. **Slave Origins & Capture** - Background detail, not critical to main plot
11. **Roman Conspiracies** - Can model conspiracy without deep research
12. **Torture & Interrogation** - Dark topic, use sparingly
13. **Death & Burial** - Atmospheric detail, not plot-critical

2. **Research in phases** - Don't try to fill all gaps at once
3. **Take notes in same format** - Match your existing research document's style
4. **Cite sources** - Keep track of where info comes from (you're already doing this well)
5. **Update your bible** - Add new sections to your roman_research file
6. **Cross-reference** - Link new info to existing sections (e.g., manumission links to rudis ceremony)

## FINAL NOTE

Your existing research is EXCELLENT and covers the sensory/atmospheric details beautifully. The gaps I've identified are primarily in:
- **Legal/social systems** (slavery, manumission, class structure)
- **Religious/cultural context** (mystery cults, superstition)
- **Political mechanics** (how power actually worked)
- **Spartacus details** (should be legendary in your story)
- **Arena ritual specifics** (cena libera, pompa, missio decisions)

Focus your additional research on the legal and social systems that drive your "slave seeking freedom" narrative. The rest is enrichment.

Good luck with your research!
