ASH & OIL
Season 1 + Season 1.5 (Deleted Scenes)
A gritty provincial drama of bodies, ink, and power—told in twelve episodes, with an additional “Season 1.5” of character-deepening scenes to support later mission breakdowns.
EPISODE 1 — THE TOKEN
EPISODE 2 — THE EMPTY ARENA
The training yard always smelled like it had been cleaned with lies.
Oil, cheap wine, sweat that had dried and been sweated again. The sand underfoot was the color of old bone, packed hard by months of men falling on it. Cassian stood with his arms out while Varro worked the oil into his shoulders, thumbs digging like he was searching for a bruise he could blame later.
“Don’t tense,” Varro muttered. His breath carried garlic and the sour edge of last night. “You want to look carved, not cornered.”
Cassian watched the other fighters through the corner of his eye—two boys circling with wooden swords, a heavy man practicing shield-work like he hated the shield, a veteran with cauliflower ears staring at nothing. Every movement in the yard had a purpose. Even the idle ones were pretending.
From the open gate, a small figure appeared.
A boy, too thin to be healthy, hair hacked short like a punishment, skin dusty as if he’d slept in the street and rubbed the night off with his hands. He didn’t enter. He hovered at the edge where sunlight hit the threshold and died.
Varro’s hands paused.
Cassian’s body went still in a different way—ready, but quiet. The boy lifted his palm.
A wax-sealed token sat there like an eye.
He didn’t smile. “They said you’d understand.”
“Who’s ‘they’?” Cassian asked.
The boy swallowed and looked past Cassian, into the yard, measuring the distance to running. “People who don’t want to be seen talking to you.”
Varro’s voice sharpened. “Out.”
The boy flinched but didn’t retreat. “Your match is fixed.”
Silence didn’t fall. It thickened. Even the wooden swords clacked slower.
Cassian stepped closer, careful not to spook him. “Fixed how?”
The boy’s lips worked, and his courage looked like something he was chewing through. “They want you to die in a certain way. The kind that makes men clap.”
Varro’s hand closed on Cassian’s arm, nails biting lightly. A warning dressed as restraint.
Cassian took the token anyway. The wax was warm, freshly pressed, the seal crisp. Whoever sent it had time, ink, and confidence.
That night, the training-house settled into its usual noises: a cough from the dorm, dice clacking in a corner, a woman laughing somewhere beyond the courtyard wall. Sabina’s house was built to feel calm even when it wasn’t.
Cassian lay awake and listened.
Not to the fighters. To the house.
A door opened softly. Footsteps crossed the tiled hallway with the delicate certainty of someone who owned the tiles. Then voices, low, behind Sabina’s study door.
“…tomorrow’s roster—”
“…Marcellus insisted—”
“…the crowd needs a message—”
Cassian slid out of his pallet and padded to the corridor. He pressed his ear to the plaster, feeling the vibration of speech without catching all the words.
A name landed cleanly: Marcellus.
Then another, blurred by distance. Rhesus—like a blade drawn halfway.
A laugh, polite and mean. “He’ll die beautifully if he’s smart.”
Cassian backed away before the floor betrayed him.
In the yard again, under moonlight, he turned the wax token in his fingers. It wasn’t just a warning. It was an invitation. Someone was already arranging his death like a centerpiece.
He went to Sabina’s door and stared at it until the candle by her threshold sputtered.
Not tonight.
But soon.
EPISODE 3 — HOUSE RULES
The arena was worse when it was empty.
No roar to cover the wet sounds. No heat of bodies in the stands. Just stone, damp in the shade, and the smell—old blood trapped in pores the way smoke trapped in cloth.
Cassian was brought through the undercorridors before sunrise with three other fighters, escorted by a guard who kept his eyes forward like he didn’t want to recognize them as human.
Varro walked beside Cassian, carrying a bundle of gear. He didn’t speak until they reached the tunnel mouth where the sand began.
“This is where you breathe,” Varro said, voice low. “Not where you think.”
Cassian stepped out onto the sand and felt the place watching. The stands were empty, but the arena had its own memory. It remembered who had begged. It remembered who had tried to crawl.
A man stood near the far gate, alone, stretching his shoulders with slow, disciplined movements. He was clean-shaven. His hair was oiled and tied back. His posture looked like a promise.
Rhesus.
He noticed Cassian the way a hawk notices motion. No hurry. No surprise. Just attention.
Cassian approached until the distance between them felt deliberate. “You’re early.”
Rhesus smiled as if the words were a courtesy he could afford. “They like to rehearse.”
Cassian glanced toward the stands. “Who does?”
Rhesus shrugged, rolling one shoulder. “Men who pay for stories. Men who can’t swing a sword but still want to decide who bleeds.”
He lowered his voice. “They’re fixing it.”
“I know.”
That caught a flicker in Rhesus’ eyes—interest, or irritation. He stepped closer, close enough Cassian could smell the sharp bite of vinegar in his breath.
“You know,” Rhesus repeated, tasting it. “Then you know they don’t rig a match unless they want a story.”
Cassian followed Rhesus’ gaze to a section of the wall where a maintenance hatch sat half-hidden. A fresh scrape marked the stone beside it.
“Someone planted something,” Rhesus said. “A weapon. An accident. A reason.”
A guard called out from the tunnel, impatient. Varro made a small motion—time.
Rhesus leaned in, too close for friendliness. “If they want you dead, they’ll get you dead. Unless you make their story expensive.”
Cassian didn’t flinch. “And you?”
Rhesus’ smile didn’t reach his eyes. “I’m the kind of expensive they like.”
When Cassian returned to the training-house, Sabina was waiting in the courtyard, dressed as if she hadn’t slept but pretending she had. Her hair was pinned neat, her face calm in the way a shut door is calm.
“You went to see the arena,” she said.
Cassian didn’t answer. He didn’t need to.
Sabina stepped closer. Her perfume was faint, expensive, layered over the smell of smoke from the kitchen. “Men talk,” she continued. “Men who enjoy imagining themselves clever.”
Cassian held her gaze. “Is it fixed?”
Sabina’s eyes didn’t blink. “Everything is fixed. That’s what money does. It fixes things.”
“And me?”
She tilted her head, almost gentle. “You’re valuable. That should comfort you.”
It didn’t.
That night, Cassian watched Sabina’s study from the shadow of a fig tree until the last lamp inside dimmed. He moved like he’d been taught—quiet feet, patient hands.
The lock wasn’t meant to keep out a determined thief. It was meant to discourage servants.
Inside, her study smelled of wax and ink. Scrolls stacked neatly. A bronze lamp shaped like a dolphin. A chest under her desk, small, iron-banded.
Cassian knelt and worked the clasp. It gave with a soft complaint.
Inside lay a sealed tablet case—waxed, heavy, wrapped in cloth. Not jewelry. Not coin. Something that mattered to people who never carried their own burdens.
Cassian lifted it, feeling the weight settle into his palms like a verdict.
In the courtyard, a dog barked once and then stopped—choked off like it had been kicked.
Cassian froze.
Footsteps approached the study door.
He slipped out the window instead, landing hard in the dirt, tablet case hugged to his chest, heart slamming against it like it wanted back out.
Behind him, Sabina’s door opened. Light spilled out.
Cassian didn’t look back.
EPISODE 4 — THE ROAD OUT
By morning, the house felt different.
Not louder. Not more dangerous in obvious ways. Just… watched.
Cassian kept the tablet case wrapped and hidden under the boards near his sleeping space. He didn’t touch it again until night, when Varro finally cornered him behind the armory.
Varro’s face was tight. “You went into her study.”
Cassian didn’t deny it. “Is the match fixed?”
Varro’s jaw worked, grinding words into something he could say. “It’s… arranged.”
“For me to die.”
Varro glanced away—shame, anger, fear, all tangled. “For you to lose. There’s a difference.”
“A story difference.”
Varro’s hand slammed the wall. Dust shook loose. “Don’t get clever with me. Clever gets you killed.”
Cassian stepped closer. “Who’s paying?”
Varro’s eyes lifted, sharp now. “Marcellus. Games patron. Smiles like he’s offering bread. He’s offering a chain.”
Cassian’s pulse steadied. Names were anchors. Marcellus. Rhesus. Sabina. A triangle, and Cassian was the meat.
Varro’s voice softened, almost pleading. “Do what they want. Take the clean fall. Survive. Then we—then I—” He swallowed the rest.
Cassian saw it then: Varro wasn’t begging for Cassian. He was begging for the house. For himself.
Later, Moth reappeared at the gate, this time inside the light, trembling with the courage of someone who’d been told to return.
“They’re looking,” he whispered. “For the case.”
Cassian’s fingers closed around the boy’s wrist. “Who?”
Moth’s eyes flicked left and right. “A clerk. Ring on his finger like a coin. He said if you bring it, you get mercy.”
“Mercy from whom?”
Moth swallowed. “From Marcellus.”
Cassian released him. Mercy from Marcellus sounded like a joke told by a man holding a knife.
That night, Cassian opened the tablet case.
Inside were thin wax tablets wrapped in oiled cloth, the wax inscribed with cramped writing, numbers, names, seals pressed beside them like fingerprints.
Cassian couldn’t read all of it. He didn’t need to. He recognized the shape of corruption the way a fighter recognizes the shape of a punch.
Payments. Deliveries. “Gifts.” Names paired with amounts, amounts paired with outcomes.
A list of who had bought what, and how.
The last tablet held a column of names—fewer, heavier. People who didn’t like being named.
One stood out: SABINA—not as a recipient, but as a conduit. A middle hand.
And beneath it, in smaller script: MARCELLUS.
Cassian closed the case and sat in the dark until the lamp died.
In the morning, Sabina announced the troupe would travel early. A “change of schedule.” Her voice was smooth, but her eyes were hard.
Cassian knew what she was doing.
Moving him.
If you can’t control the fire, you move it somewhere it can burn someone else.
As the carts rolled out, Cassian glanced back at the house. Varro walked beside him, silent, eyes forward.
Moth slipped into the line like a shadow that had decided to keep up.
Behind them, somewhere on the road, hooves sounded—distant, patient, and not part of their group.
EPISODE 5 — THE QUARRY BREATHES
Travel wasn’t heroic. It was ache.
Cassian’s hands blistered from gripping cart rails. Dust coated his tongue. At night, the cold crept in like an animal, nosing under cloaks, into bones.
They stopped at roadside stations where men stared too long and women stared not at all. Cassian kept the tablet case close, wrapped under his blanket, feeling its corners dig into him whenever he shifted.
Moth lingered near Cassian like a stray that had chosen him. The boy spoke in fragments—things he’d heard, things he shouldn’t repeat. He’d been running messages for years, he said. For clerks, for gamblers, for men who bought silence with a smile.
“And you’re still alive?” Cassian asked one night, sharing a crust of bread.
Moth shrugged, chewing like it hurt. “I don’t take messages that smell like blood.”
Cassian almost laughed. “And this one didn’t?”
Moth’s eyes slid away. “It does now.”
On the third day, they reached Ridge City.
It sat under the hills like it had been pressed there by a thumb. Smoke drifted from vents in the earth. The air tasted faintly of minerals, like licking stone.
Quarry men moved through the streets—broad backs, hollow eyes. Their coughs sounded wet and practiced.
Varro took Cassian to a bathhouse meant for fighters—warm water, harsh scrubbing, the illusion of care. Cassian watched men stare at his scars like they were reading a map.
A man approached in clean sandals—too clean for the street—accompanied by two guards who wore their weapons like decorations.
“You are Cassian,” the man said, smiling as if stating a fact was a gift. “I serve the city magistrates.”
Cassian didn’t respond.
The man’s smile held. “There is concern about… stolen property. A tablet case.”
Varro stiffened beside Cassian. Cassian could feel the betrayal in Varro’s posture even before any words.
The man continued, voice soft. “Return it, and you will be protected. Kept from… accidents.”
One guard’s belt held a strap Cassian recognized—leather stamped with Sabina’s house mark. Not supposed to be on that man. Not unless another fighter had been stripped and dumped.
Cassian’s mouth went dry. “Protected by you?”
The man’s eyes flickered—annoyance at being questioned. “By the city.”
Cassian stepped closer, forcing the man to tilt his head back. “The city doesn’t protect men like me. It uses men like me. That’s why you’re here.”
The smile slipped for half a breath. Then returned, tighter.
“Consider,” the man said, and walked away like he’d left a blessing.
That night, Cassian climbed onto the lodging roof and stared at the hills. In the distance, faint red glowed where the earth breathed heat. The ground felt alive beneath him, too warm for comfort.
Moth sat beside him, knees to chest. “They’ll take it,” he whispered. “If not here, then later.”
Cassian looked down at the streets—thin, twisting, full of shadows. “Then we make later expensive.”
Below them, Varro spoke quietly with someone near the stable.
Cassian didn’t hear the words.
He heard the tone.
EPISODE 6 — BROKEN TRUST
The next day, a quarry boss invited Sabina’s troupe to “perform” for workers—an exhibition of strength, a reminder of order.
Cassian was marched to the quarry edge and made to spar with blunt steel while men watched with flat hunger. Their faces weren’t excited. They were tired. Like watching violence was the closest they got to feeling alive.
During the bout, Cassian noticed a man in the crowd with ink-stained fingers and a hood drawn low. The man didn’t clap. He watched Cassian’s hands, his footwork, his attention.
When Cassian’s opponent stumbled, Cassian could have pressed and made it ugly. Instead, he stepped back, letting the man regain footing. It wasn’t mercy. It was control. Cassian wasn’t giving them the story they wanted for free.
Later, in a narrow alley behind the lodging, Cassian felt someone tailing him. He turned suddenly, grabbing a wrist.
Ink-stained fingers. Hooded man. A clerk type, but with calluses that didn’t fit.
“Easy,” the man hissed. “I’m not here to fight.”
“Then don’t stalk me like a thief.”
The man’s eyes were sharp. “The ledger is being copied.”
Cassian’s grip tightened. “By who?”
“By whoever survives long enough to hold it.” The man’s gaze flicked toward the street. “You think there’s only one set of hands? Marcellus wants it buried. The port wants it returned. The shrine wants it purified. Your mistress wants it leveraged. Your trainer wants it gone.”
Cassian’s throat tightened at the word trainer. “Varro—”
The man pulled free. “Everyone wants the same thing: to be the last person named.”
Cassian didn’t chase him. Chasing made you obvious. He returned to the lodging and found Moth waiting, pale and shaking.
“They grabbed me,” Moth whispered. He lifted his shirt to show a bruise shaped like a handprint. “They said tell you… bring the case, or next time they won’t let go.”
Cassian’s jaw clenched until it hurt.
That night, in the dorm, a quarry “accident” screamed through the city—men running, lanterns bobbing, shouts swallowed by distance. Varro rose from his pallet like he’d been waiting for a cue.
Sabina’s voice drifted from the hallway, calm as a blade. “We leave at first light.”
Cassian lay awake, hearing the city’s coughs, the earth’s faint groan, and Varro’s breathing beside him—steady, practiced, like a man trying to convince himself he wasn’t about to choose the wrong side.
When morning came, the ink-stained man was gone.
But Cassian found something new near the stable: a strip of wax, peeled clean, with the faint impression of a seal.
Someone had copied a page.
Now the ledger existed in more than one place.
And that meant Cassian could be blamed no matter what he did.
EPISODE 7 — EDUCATION
The road to Port City ran through lowlands that smelled like wet grass and rot. The closer they got, the more carts they passed—amphorae, timber, cages covered in cloth that moved when the wind shifted.
At a roadside stop, Varro pulled Cassian aside. His hands shook when he pretended they didn’t.
“Listen,” Varro said. “You can’t win this by defiance.”
Cassian stared at him. “You already made a deal.”
Varro’s face flinched. “I talked.”
“To who?”
Varro’s eyes watered, furious at himself for it. “To keep you alive.”
Cassian’s voice lowered. “No. You talked to keep the house alive. To keep you alive.”
Varro’s jaw tightened. “What do you want from me? I’m not a hero. I’m a man who’s seen what happens to men who pretend they are.”
Cassian stepped in close, almost touching forehead to forehead. “Then stop pretending you’re on my side.”
They arrived in Port City under a sky the color of old tin. The harbor stank of fish, tar, and spilled wine. Men shouted in half a dozen accents. Goods moved like tides—always flowing, always stolen from somewhere.
Cassian tried to disappear in it.
He failed.
Two men approached him near a warehouse, their faces forgettable on purpose. One smiled like he’d been practicing.
“The Quill would like a word.”
Cassian’s hand went to the knife at his belt—small, not meant for a duel, meant for close truth. The smiling man didn’t flinch.
“This isn’t an arrest,” the man said. “It’s business.”
Cassian glanced at Varro. Varro didn’t meet his eyes.
They led Cassian beneath the warehouse into a room that smelled of wet wood and ink. A single lamp burned on a table. Wax seals sat in a dish like teeth.
A man waited there, hood up, face shadowed. His hands were clean. His fingernails trimmed.
He didn’t introduce himself. He didn’t need to.
“Ledger,” he said.
Cassian didn’t speak.
The man sighed, as if Cassian was making it tedious. “I don’t care about your pride. I care about names. Names are expensive.”
Cassian’s voice was flat. “What do you want?”
The hooded man leaned forward. “Return it, and you walk away.”
“And if I don’t?”
The man’s hands opened, empty. “Then we take the boy.”
Cassian’s skin went cold. “Moth—”
A muffled sound came from the shadows behind Cassian: a chair scrape, a soft whimper. Moth’s voice, swallowed.
Cassian’s vision tunneled. He turned, but a blade touched his ribs—gentle, precise. Not a threat. A demonstration.
The hooded man spoke softly, almost kind. “You can pay in coin, in flesh, in silence… or in someone else.”
Cassian forced his breathing steady. “You work for Marcellus.”
The hooded man laughed quietly. “Marcellus pays for theater. I pay for truth.”
Cassian’s eyes burned. “Let the boy go.”
“Give me the ledger.”
Cassian stared at the lamp flame. He could feel the heat on his cheeks. He thought about Sabina’s calm. Varro’s fear. Rhesus’ warning. The quarry coughs. The shrine bells he hadn’t heard yet.
Then he said, “No.”
The blade at his ribs pressed a fraction deeper, drawing a bead of blood that felt hot and immediate.
The hooded man sighed again. “Then we educate you.”
EPISODE 8 — RHESUS IN SALT LIGHT
They didn’t beat Cassian. Not the way brutes beat.
They sat him at a table and made him listen while the hooded man spoke about debts the way a priest speaks about sin—patient, certain, sure the universe agreed with him.
The hooded man slid a wax tablet across the table. “Read that.”
Cassian didn’t touch it.
The man’s voice hardened. “Read.”
Cassian picked it up. It wasn’t the ledger. It was a shipping manifest. Names, weights, destinations. The kind of thing that seemed dull until you knew how to read between lines.
“Those crates,” the man said, tapping the tablet, “are listed as olives.”
Cassian said nothing.
The man leaned in. “They are not olives.”
Cassian’s stomach tightened. “What are they?”
The man smiled, thin. “Sometimes—animals. Sometimes—people. Sometimes—things that make men burn from the inside.”
Cassian’s fingers clenched, anger sharp enough to taste. “Why are you telling me this?”
“Because you are going to do a job.” The hooded man slid another tablet forward. “You will sabotage one shipment. Make it disappear. Make it look like an accident.”
Cassian looked up. “Why?”
“Because Marcellus is trying to seize port assets under the excuse of restoring order.” The hooded man’s voice turned conversational. “If his rival loses this shipment, Marcellus gains leverage.”
Cassian understood. The ledger wasn’t the only weapon. The port’s underworld was already fighting its own war; Cassian was just being fitted into it.
“And if I refuse?” Cassian asked.
The hooded man gestured toward the shadows. Moth whimpered softly again—alive, but not okay.
Cassian’s throat tightened until swallowing hurt.
He took the tablet.
The job was simple on paper. In practice, it meant creeping along wet docks at night, cutting a rope the right way, loosening a plank, setting the collapse so it killed the shipment and not the men moving it.
Cassian moved through darkness like a cat, breath held, hands steady.
When the crate slipped, it hit the water with a heavy splash, a sound swallowed quickly by harbor noise. Men shouted, lanterns swung, boots thudded.
Cassian melted into shadow.
Back under the warehouse, the hooded man nodded as if Cassian had passed a lesson.
“Good,” he said. “You learn quickly.”
Cassian’s eyes were dead. “Now the boy.”
The hooded man raised a hand, and someone dragged Moth forward—bruise-dark, lip split, eyes glassy with pain he wasn’t crying about. The boy swayed but stayed upright.
Cassian stepped toward him. Moth tried to smile and failed.
The hooded man’s voice drifted behind Cassian. “You’re not free, fighter. You’re just borrowed.”
Cassian didn’t look back. He took Moth’s weight and walked out into the night.
On the street above, Port City kept moving. Laughter, bargaining, a woman singing off-key in a doorway. Life piled on top of violence like it always did.
Moth whispered, barely audible. “They said… there’s a page missing.”
Cassian’s grip tightened. “What page?”
Moth blinked slowly. “The one with the clean names.”
Cassian’s stomach turned.
Someone else had the part of the story that mattered most.
EPISODE 9 — CANDLE ECONOMY
Rhesus trained in public near the docks like he was a festival all by himself.
A circle of men watched him practice, cheering whenever his blade flicked fast enough to look like magic. He performed for them—smiling, letting them believe he belonged to them.
Cassian waited until the crowd thinned. Then he approached, Moth lingering nearby like a shadow with bruises.
Rhesus saw him and dismissed the last spectator with a wink. When they were alone, his smile dropped. The performance ended like a curtain.
“You look worse,” Rhesus said.
Cassian glanced at Rhesus’ perfect arms, his unmarked face. “You look the same.”
Rhesus’ jaw tightened. “That’s not a compliment.”
Cassian watched him closely. “Do you know about the ledger?”
Rhesus exhaled, slow. “I know about a lot of ledgers.”
Cassian leaned in. “They’re steering you too.”
Rhesus didn’t deny it. His eyes went distant, as if he was staring at the arena wall even here by the water. “They steer everyone. Some of us just wear nicer reins.”
Moth shifted, restless. “Marcellus—”
Rhesus cut him off gently, but firm. “Don’t say names too loud. Names travel.”
Cassian’s voice was quiet. “They want me dead. Then they want me a symbol. Then they want me obedient. I’m tired of being useful.”
Rhesus’ laugh was short and bitter. “Then be dangerous.”
Cassian held his gaze. “How?”
Rhesus looked down at Cassian’s hands. “You can’t outfight the city. You can only outstory it. Make the crowd see the hand that’s moving them.”
Cassian’s throat tightened. “And if the crowd doesn’t care?”
Rhesus’ eyes flickered. “They care when they realize they’ve been made fools. Pride is a cheap fuel. It burns fast.”
That night, Cassian and Moth moved through port alleys toward a contact Moth claimed he knew—a runner who owed him a favor. They found the man dead behind a tavern, face in the gutter, eyes open like he was still watching.
No one screamed. No one gathered.
In Port City, bodies were punctuation.
Moth’s hands shook. “That’s for me,” he whispered. “That’s for… knowing.”
Cassian pulled him away before anyone could see them lingering.
Back at their lodging, Varro waited.
Cassian stopped in the doorway. Varro’s face was drawn. He looked older than he had in Arena City.
“We’re leaving,” Varro said.
Cassian’s voice was flat. “Why?”
Varro swallowed. “Because the port wants the ledger. The ridge wants it. Sabina wants it back. And Marcellus—” He stopped himself, like saying the name would summon something.
Cassian stepped inside. “You made your deal.”
Varro’s eyes flashed with anger. “I made a deal to keep us alive.”
Cassian shook his head slowly. “No. You made a deal so you could sleep.”
Varro’s hand clenched. Then loosened. His voice dropped, defeated. “If you keep this up, you’ll die and take us with you.”
Cassian looked at Moth—bruise-dark, jaw clenched like he was holding himself together by force.
Then Cassian said, “Good.”
Varro stared at him.
Cassian’s eyes were steady. “If the machine needs me dead, I’m not giving it a clean death. I’m going to break something on the way down.”
EPISODE 10 — TREMOR
Shrine Town smelled like wax and flowers laid on stone to rot politely.
The streets were cleaner than the port, quieter than Ridge City. Men spoke softer. Even arguments sounded respectful.
Cassian didn’t trust it.
Moth walked close, shoulders hunched, eyes darting at every doorway. Varro stayed behind, pretending he wasn’t afraid of this place’s calm.
They found the shrine at the town’s center—columns, steps worn by feet that believed.
A woman met them at the threshold. She wasn’t dressed richly. Her hands were plain. Her gaze was the kind that didn’t flinch from ugly truths.
“Iona,” she said, as if introducing herself was the first test. “You’re the fighter.”
Cassian didn’t bow. “I’m just passing through.”
Iona’s mouth twitched—almost a smile, but not warm. “Passing through is what travelers tell themselves so they don’t have to admit they’re running.”
Cassian held her gaze. “Do you help runners?”
“We help whoever pays,” she said softly. Then, after a beat: “Sometimes the payment isn’t coin.”
Inside, the shrine’s air was thick with incense. Candles flickered in alcoves, their smoke curling like fingers. People knelt, murmuring, eyes squeezed shut as if trying to squeeze answers out of themselves.
Cassian watched an old man press a coin into a priest’s hand before touching a statue’s foot.
Everything here was transaction dressed as devotion.
Iona guided them through back corridors. “You have something,” she said. “Something people want.”
Cassian didn’t answer.
She stopped near a small chamber where a young woman sat with her eyes rolled back, mouth slack. A circle of onlookers murmured prayers.
Iona leaned close to Cassian and whispered, “She isn’t seeing visions. She’s hungry and drugged.”
Cassian’s jaw clenched.
Iona’s voice stayed even. “People need miracles. If we don’t give them one, they make their own—and those are worse.”
Cassian glanced at the girl’s trembling hands, at the priest’s careful posture, at the crowd’s desperate faces.
“Why tell me?” Cassian asked.
Iona’s eyes were sharp. “Because you’re not here to be saved. You’re here to bargain. And I won’t bargain with a man who still believes in clean lies.”
That night, Iona offered Cassian a deal.
“Give the ledger to us,” she said, “and we’ll move it through the shrine network. It will be protected. It will travel. It will survive.”
Cassian stared at a candle flame until it blurred. “And what do you want?”
Iona didn’t hesitate. “We want leverage. We want to keep Marcellus from swallowing this town. We want to keep the port syndicate from buying our priests. We want—” Her voice hardened slightly. “—to stay standing.”
Moth whispered, “They’ll use it.”
Iona’s gaze flicked to the boy. “Everyone uses everything. The difference is whether you admit it.”
Cassian asked the question that mattered. “And what do you want from me?”
Iona’s voice softened, and that softness was more dangerous than anger. “A symbol. A story. A fighter who survived corruption and chose faith.”
Cassian’s stomach tightened. “I’m not faithful.”
Iona’s eyes didn’t blink. “You don’t have to be. You just have to look like it.”
Cassian stepped back.
In the distance, a bell rang once, low and heavy.
Somewhere beyond the shrine, the ground gave a faint shiver—small, almost nothing.
But the candle flames all leaned the same direction for a heartbeat, like they were listening too.
EPISODE 11 — RETURN TO THE MOUTH
The tremor came at dawn.
Not a cataclysm. Not a dramatic collapse. Just a deep shudder, like the earth flexing its shoulders. Plaster cracked. Birds shrieked and scattered. A cup rolled off a table and shattered with a sharp, final sound.
People froze. Then pretended it hadn’t happened.
Cassian stood in the shrine corridor and watched a priest smooth his robe with shaking hands, then lift his chin as if the gods had merely cleared their throats.
Iona found Cassian near the back door. Her face was pale, but controlled. “They’ve decided,” she said.
“Who?”
“The elders. The donors. The men who think candles are weapons.” She swallowed. “They want the ledger.”
Cassian’s voice was flat. “Of course they do.”
“They want it,” Iona continued, “and they want the boy as proof you’ll obey.”
Cassian’s skin went cold. “Moth—”
A shout echoed through the shrine, followed by scuffling footsteps. Moth’s voice yelped—pain, surprise.
Cassian moved before thought finished forming. He ran toward the sound, knocking past a man carrying incense.
He found Moth pinned against a wall by two shrine guards—local men, not soldiers. Their faces weren’t cruel. That was worse. They looked like they believed they were doing something necessary.
“Cassian,” one guard said, breathless. “Don’t—”
Cassian hit him anyway.
Not with rage. With precision. Palm to throat, elbow to jaw, the kind of violence that ended a conversation fast.
The second guard drew a short blade. Cassian took his wrist and bent it until the blade clattered to the floor. The guard cried out, more shocked than hurt.
Iona appeared behind them, eyes wide.
“This is what I meant,” Cassian said to her, breathing hard. “Networks protect themselves.”
Iona’s face tightened with shame and fury. “I didn’t order it.”
“I know,” Cassian snapped. “That doesn’t matter.”
They ran through back corridors, Moth stumbling, clutching Cassian’s sleeve like a lifeline. The shrine seemed to narrow around them, walls closing in, smoke thickening.
At the back gate, a group of men waited.
Not guards. Not priests.
Clean sandals. Better cloth. A familiar ring.
The soft-handed clerk from Arena City.
He smiled, gentle as ever. “There you are.”
Cassian’s hand moved toward his knife. The clerk raised his palm calmly. “Don’t. Not here. Not in front of the shrine. They like you clean.”
Cassian’s voice was low. “Where’s Marcellus?”
The clerk’s smile widened. “Close enough.”
Iona hissed, “You brought him here.”
The clerk glanced at her like she was furniture that had started talking. “The ledger belongs to its owners. You were never meant to carry it far.”
Cassian looked at the clerk’s ring, then at the men behind him, then at the shrine doors behind him—trapped between faith and power like a rat between walls.
He made a choice that felt like swallowing glass.
He threw the tablet case—not to the clerk, but past him, into a cluster of pilgrims who gasped and scrambled as it hit the ground.
The clerk’s calm broke. Men lunged.
Cassian grabbed Moth and shoved him through the gate as Iona slammed it behind them. The clerk’s fist hit wood. The ring flashed.
They ran down a narrow street as bells began to ring—not for prayer, but for alarm.
Behind them, the shrine was waking up angry.
Ahead, the road back to Arena City waited like a throat.
Cassian’s lungs burned. His hands were empty.
He didn’t know who had the ledger now.
Only that everyone would claim he did.
EPISODE 12 — NOON BLOOD
They made it back to Arena City on sore feet and stolen bread.
The city greeted them with banners.
Games week.
Color in the streets like fresh bruises. Vendors shouting. Children weaving through crowds with sweet cakes. The smell of roasted meat and spilled wine thick enough to hide fear.
Cassian pushed through it with Moth close behind, Iona hooded and silent, Varro trailing like a man who’d accepted he might die soon.
Sabina’s house loomed the same—white walls, tidy courtyard, order pretending it wasn’t built on flesh.
Sabina met them at the gate. She didn’t embrace Cassian. She didn’t even look relieved.
She looked calculating.
“You’ve caused trouble,” she said.
Cassian’s voice was flat. “You started it.”
Sabina’s eyes flicked to Iona. “And you brought a shrine girl into my yard.”
Iona’s chin lifted. “He brought himself.”
Sabina’s mouth tightened. “Where is my property?”
Cassian stared at her. “It stopped being yours when you sold my death.”
A beat of silence.
Then Sabina sighed, as if Cassian had tracked mud onto her floor. “Marcellus is here,” she said. “He wants you seen.”
“Of course he does,” Cassian replied.
Varro grabbed Cassian’s arm, grip desperate. “Don’t go alone.”
Cassian looked down at Varro’s hand. “You made your deal.”
Varro’s voice cracked. “And I regret it.”
Cassian studied him. Regret was cheap, but the crack in Varro’s voice was real.
In the afternoon, Cassian was escorted to a private viewing chamber overlooking the arena floor. The room smelled of perfume and money. Cushioned seats. Wine laid out like it was an offering.
Marcellus stood near the open archway, gazing down at the arena as if it belonged to him. He was handsome in the way power often was—clean, confident, sure the world would arrange itself around his desires.
He turned and smiled at Cassian like they were old friends.
“Cassian,” he said warmly. “There you are.”
Cassian didn’t bow.
Marcellus didn’t seem to mind. “I’ve heard stories,” he continued. “About your defiance. Your… stubbornness.” His smile widened. “It’s admirable. It’s useful.”
Cassian’s voice was quiet. “I’m not your tool.”
Marcellus walked closer, hands open. “All men are tools. The wise ones choose whose hand holds them.”
Cassian stared at him. “And what story do you want?”
Marcellus’ eyes gleamed. “A righteous victory. A public cleansing. A fighter who proves the city still has teeth.”
Cassian felt the trap settle around him, soft as silk, tight as wire.
“You’ll win,” Marcellus said, still smiling. “You’ll win in a way that makes the crowd roar for order.” He gestured toward the arena. “And when they roar, I will give them what they want.”
Cassian’s throat went dry. “A purge.”
Marcellus’ smile didn’t change. “Restoration.”
Cassian understood then: the fix had evolved. He wasn’t being killed to send a message. He was being used to justify what came after.
Marcellus leaned closer, voice almost kind. “Play your part, and you’ll be rewarded. Papers. Coin. A place.”
Cassian thought of “freedom” as a paper that could be torn. A gift that could be revoked. A chain that looked like a ribbon.
He looked Marcellus in the eyes and said, “No.”
Marcellus’ smile slipped—just enough to show teeth.
“Then you’ll learn,” Marcellus said softly, “what happens to men who refuse to be useful.”
Games day arrived like a fever.
Drums in the streets. Processions. Bright cloth. The crowd’s roar building before anything even happened, like hunger starting early.
Cassian stood in the tunnel, sand under his feet, the air damp and cold. Above him, the arena shook with sound. He could hear individual shouts—names, curses, laughter—blended into one animal voice.
Varro strapped Cassian’s arm guard with hands that wouldn’t steady. “I can get you out,” Varro whispered. “After. If you—”
Cassian cut him off. “If I obey.”
Varro’s face twisted. “If you live.”
Cassian looked past him at the tunnel mouth. “Living isn’t the same as surviving.”
Moth hovered nearby, eyes wide, jaw clenched. Iona stood behind him, face unreadable, hands folded as if prayer could become a weapon.
A horn sounded.
Cassian stepped forward.
The arena exploded into light and noise. Heat slammed into him. The sand felt almost hot. The crowd roared his name—some in love, some in hatred, some because it was fun to yell at a man who couldn’t answer back.
Across the sand stood Rhesus.
He looked perfect—armor clean, stance balanced, face calm like a statue. But his eyes were tired, and in that tiredness Cassian saw the same cage.
They approached each other slowly.
Rhesus spoke under his breath, lips barely moving. “They want a riot.”
Cassian’s voice was quiet. “I know.”
Rhesus’ eyes flicked toward the officials’ platform. Marcellus sat there, radiant, composed, already enjoying his future.
“A planted weapon,” Rhesus murmured. “Near the wall hatch.”
Cassian nodded slightly.
They began to fight.
Not a performance fight. Not the clean choreography the crowd loved. Cassian fought messy—forcing positions that dragged them toward the wall, toward the hatch, toward the scrape mark he’d noticed weeks ago.
The crowd booed at first. Confused. Angry that the story wasn’t going as expected.
Rhesus feinted high. Cassian caught it, let the blade slide along his guard with a shriek of metal. They collided. Cassian’s shoulder slammed into Rhesus’ chest, driving him back.
Rhesus hissed, “Now.”
Cassian hooked Rhesus’ leg and shoved, and both men crashed near the wall. Cassian’s hand shot out—not for Rhesus, but for the maintenance hatch.
His fingers found the edge. He yanked.
The hatch popped open.
A blade clattered out into the sand—a clean, sharp weapon, wrapped in cloth as if hidden for an “accident.” The crowd’s roar faltered, a ripple of confusion spreading like spilled ink.
Cassian grabbed the blade and lifted it high.
He didn’t speak—he couldn’t. The crowd was too loud, too messy. But he held it up long enough for the nearest spectators to see it wasn’t his.
Officials stood abruptly, shouting orders. A referee rushed forward, face pale, eyes darting to Marcellus’ platform like he needed permission to breathe.
Cassian pointed the blade at the officials.
The crowd’s confusion tipped into anger.
Because people could forgive cruelty.
They hated being made fools.
Shouts turned sharp. Bottles flew. A man in the stands punched another. A section surged, pushing toward the rail.
Rhesus stepped close to Cassian, voice tight. “Do it.”
Cassian’s heart hammered.
“Do what?” Cassian hissed.
Rhesus’ eyes were grim. “Make it public. Make it impossible to bury.”
Cassian thought of the ledger—lost, stolen, scattered. Thought of the copy. Thought of the missing page. Thought of a story that could be rewritten unless it got loose among mouths that couldn’t be controlled.
He made a decision.
He turned and hurled the planted blade—not at a man, but toward the officials’ platform. It struck the stone steps and skittered, loud, undeniable.
The crowd howled.
Guards surged.
Smoke rose—someone had thrown a torch into a vendor’s cloth awning. Fire caught fast, licking upward.
Marcellus stood, hands raised, trying to speak, trying to control.
But the crowd wasn’t listening anymore.
Cassian grabbed Rhesus’ wrist for a heartbeat—not friendship, not forgiveness—recognition. Two men trapped in the same machine.
Then Cassian ran.
He sprinted for the tunnel as guards poured onto the sand. Behind him, the arena became a storm—riot, fire, shouting. The city eating itself in broad daylight.
In the undercorridors, Varro grabbed him, dragging him into a side passage. “This way,” Varro gasped. “Move!”
Moth and Iona followed, breathless, eyes wide.
They burst into the city’s back streets where smoke already drifted over rooftops. Bells rang—not worship now, but warning.
At a narrow alley mouth, a patrol blocked their path.
The guard captain raised a hand. “Cassian,” he said politely, as if greeting a guest. “You are requested.”
Cassian’s blood went cold. “By who?”
The captain’s smile was courteous. “By Marcellus. He offers patronage. Protection. A way to make this… clean.”
Cassian stared at the guard’s calm face and understood the final cruelty:
Even riot could be folded into a story, if the right man got to narrate it.
Cassian looked at Moth—bruised, stubbornly standing. Looked at Varro—sweat-soaked, shaking. Looked at Iona—eyes hard, jaw set.
Then Cassian said, “No.”
He turned and ran the other way—into the smoke, into the city’s cracks, into whatever came next.
Behind him, the captain’s voice followed, still polite:
“Then you’ll be treated as what you are, Cassian.”
Cassian didn’t slow.
He didn’t ask what that meant.
He already knew.

SEASON 1.5 — DELETED SCENES (Character Deepening)
SCENE 1 — SABINA COUNTS THE HOUSE (after Episode 2)
SCENE 2 — VARRO’S DEAL (between Episodes 4 and 5)
Sabina didn’t shout when she discovered the study window ajar.
She just stood in the doorway, candle in hand, and let the draft brush her knuckles. The flame leaned toward the open air like it wanted to escape.
Her clerk hovered behind her, throat tight. The man’s ring caught the candlelight—too fine for his hands, too clean for his life.
“Say it,” Sabina murmured.
The clerk licked his lips. “The case is gone.”
Sabina stepped into the room and knelt by the iron-banded chest as if it were a sick child. She touched the clasp, feeling the faint smear of oil left behind. Someone careful. Someone trained.
She rose and walked to her desk. The papers were still neat. The lamp still polished. Whoever had done it hadn’t rummaged. They’d taken one thing and left like it was owed.
“Which fighter?” the clerk asked, stupidly hopeful it wasn’t the valuable one.
Sabina didn’t answer at first. She looked at the window, the fig tree outside, the path a man would take if he moved like he believed walls weren’t real.
Then she said, “Cassian.”
The clerk inhaled sharply. “We should—”
Sabina cut him off with a small glance. Not anger. Just ownership. “If we strike him now, we make him important. We make him a cause.”
“He stole from you,” the clerk insisted.
Sabina’s mouth turned slightly. “He stole from Marcellus.”
That silenced the clerk.
Sabina walked to the shelf where wax sticks were kept, chose one without thinking, and rolled it between her fingers. Her nails were clean. Her hands were steady.
“Send word,” she said.
“To Marcellus?”
Sabina’s eyes didn’t leave the wax. “To everyone.”
The clerk hesitated. “Everyone?”
Sabina looked up. Her gaze was cold enough to feel like metal. “If Cassian is carrying the case, then we make him a fire no one can touch without getting burned.”
“What does that do for us?” the clerk asked.
Sabina smiled, the kind that never reached the eyes. “It makes the house necessary.”
She turned away, already done with him. “And if you ever ask me what something does for us again, I will find a less curious clerk.”
The clerk bowed and backed out.
Sabina stayed alone in her study, the candle’s flame reflected in bronze and glass, and listened to the house settle into sleep.
Then she whispered—not prayer, not regret:
“Run, Cassian.”
As if daring him to become useful in a way she hadn’t planned.
SCENE 3 — MOTH LEARNS SEALS (flashback)
Varro met the magistrate’s man behind the stable where the horses sweated through the night.
Lantern light made the straw look gold. It made the world look kinder than it was.
The man waited with two guards, posture loose, smile practiced. Clean sandals. Clean hands. A man who could ruin you without raising his voice.
Varro kept his own hands visible. A habit you learned when your life depended on strangers believing you meant no sudden harm.
“You sent for me,” Varro said.
The man’s smile widened. “I asked for you. There’s a difference.”
Varro’s jaw clenched. “If this is about the case—”
“It’s about order,” the man said, as if that explained everything. “The fighter has caused uncertainty. That’s unhealthy. For the city. For your house.”
Varro swallowed. “He’s stubborn.”
“He’s valuable,” the man corrected gently. “Value can be redirected.”
One of the guards shifted, and Varro saw the house mark stamped into the leather on his belt. Sabina’s mark. A piece taken from someone who hadn’t kept breathing.
Varro’s stomach turned, but he forced his voice steady. “What do you want?”
The magistrate’s man stepped closer, lowering his voice like they were sharing a secret. “We want the case returned. Quietly.”
Varro’s throat went dry. “It’s not mine to give.”
“Everything in your yard is yours to deliver,” the man said. “That’s what a trainer is. A delivery system for meat.”
Varro flinched at the bluntness. He hated that the words were true.
The man’s eyes softened, faux sympathy. “Help us, and your house remains untroubled. Your fighters remain… insurable.”
“And Cassian?” Varro asked, because he couldn’t stop himself.
The man smiled. “If Cassian cooperates, he lives.”
Varro heard what wasn’t said: if Cassian doesn’t, then Varro had sold the address of the knife.
Varro looked past the man to the dark road where Cassian slept somewhere in the cart line, unaware of this small commerce happening on his behalf.
“Give me something,” Varro said hoarsely. “A promise. A seal. Something I can hold if you decide to change your mind.”
The man nodded as if Varro had asked for a child’s toy. He produced a small wax tablet and pressed his seal into it with slow care.
“Here,” he said. “An assurance of goodwill.”
Varro stared at the seal imprint—clean, perfect, official. It looked like safety.
He took it, and it felt like ash in his hand.
SCENE 4 — RHESUS WITHOUT THE CROWD (before Episode 8)
Before Cassian, there was the alley behind the wine shop where Moth learned how ink controlled men.
He was younger then. Smaller. Hungrier in a way that made hunger seem like a personality.
A runner twice his age shoved him against a wall and held a wax token up to his nose.
“Smell it,” the runner said.
Moth blinked, confused. “It smells like—”
“Like wax,” the runner snapped. “No. Smell what’s under it.”
Moth inhaled again. Something faint: resin. Oil. A sweet note that didn’t belong on the street.
“Rich wax,” the runner said. “Temple stock. They buy it clean. That means the message is clean. That means the hands are dirty.”
Moth didn’t understand, but he nodded anyway because nodding kept him alive.
The runner shoved the token into his palm. “If the seal is cracked, you’re dead. If the seal is wrong, you’re dead. If you open it, you’re dead.”
Moth stared at the impression—an animal, a symbol, a name pressed into soft wax until it became law.
“How do I know it’s wrong?” Moth asked.
The runner’s laugh was ugly. “You don’t. That’s why you run fast.”
Moth learned to memorize seals. To recognize the way a real one pressed and the way a fake one smeared. He learned that men who couldn’t read still feared the look of official wax.
He learned that a boy with good eyes could become useful.
Useful boys lived longer.
Sometimes.
SCENE 5 — IONA’S ARGUMENT (before Episode 10)
Rhesus sat in a bathhouse stall alone, scraping sand from his knuckles.
The water had gone lukewarm. Steam clung to the ceiling in a low haze. Around him, men laughed in other stalls, bragging about fights, about women, about nothing—anything to pretend the arena wasn’t waiting.
Rhesus flexed his fingers and watched the skin split at the crease. Small wounds. The kind that didn’t get songs.
He heard voices from the corridor—Marcellus’ men. Two of them. Laughing softly like they were enjoying themselves.
“…Cassian thinks he’s a man,” one said.
“He’s meat,” the other replied. “Just louder meat.”
Rhesus’ jaw tightened. He kept scraping.
“…and if he won’t die cleanly?”
A pause. Then a shrug in the voice. “Then we make him win. Let him light the fuse. We’ll call it order after.”
Rhesus closed his eyes. He pictured the arena: sand, sun, the crowd’s mouth open wide.
He pictured Cassian’s face—sharp, quiet, full of the kind of defiance that got men admired right up until it got them buried.
Rhesus rose, water sliding off him, and wrapped cloth around his waist. In the mirror, his expression looked calm.
He practiced that expression more than he practiced the sword.
In the corridor, the voices moved away.
Rhesus exhaled once, long.
Then he whispered, to no one: “Don’t make me choose.”
The words sounded like weakness in the steam.
SCENE 6 — MARCELLUS CHOOSES THE SCRIPT (between Episodes 10 and 11)
Iona stood before the shrine elders with her hands folded in front of her like she was praying.
She wasn’t.
She was keeping them from shaking.
The elders sat on low benches, robes neat, faces soft with age and hard with certainty. Behind them, donors stood in fine cloth, wearing devotion like jewelry.
“The fighter is trouble,” an elder said. “Trouble attracts Rome’s attention.”
“Rome’s attention can be bought,” a donor replied, smiling. “We buy it often.”
Iona kept her voice even. “He didn’t come to be saved. He came because you’re the only network that reaches every class. That’s why you’re afraid.”
A murmur. Annoyance.
One elder leaned forward. “Mind your tone.”
Iona met his gaze. “Mind your hunger.”
A hush fell. Someone inhaled sharply. Not outrage—surprise that she’d dared.
The donor’s smile thinned. “We could replace you,” he said gently, as if offering a suggestion.
Iona nodded once. “You replace hands all the time. You don’t replace what hands know.”
The elder’s voice turned cold. “Bring us the ledger. Bring us the boy. If the fighter won’t obey, he’ll be corrected.”
Iona’s stomach tightened. “You’ll call it correction. Others will call it kidnapping.”
The donor shrugged. “Names are flexible.”
Iona looked at the candle flame behind them, steady, indifferent. She thought about the girl in the vision chamber. Thought about how often she’d helped arrange “miracles” so desperate people could keep breathing one more day.
Then she said, quietly, “If you touch the boy, you don’t get to call yourselves holy again. Not even in your own mouths.”
The elder’s eyes narrowed. “You’re sentimental.”
Iona’s jaw clenched. “No. I’m practical. Sentiment gets you buried. Practicality keeps you human.”
She turned and walked out before they could dismiss her, heart hammering, knowing she’d just stepped out of the protection of obedience.
Outside, the air smelled of wax and morning.
Iona whispered a prayer she didn’t fully believe, because belief wasn’t required to beg:
Let him run fast.
SCENE 7 — THE COPIED PAGE (after Episode 5)
Marcellus watched the arena from his balcony as if it were a garden.
Below, workers raked the sand smooth. The lines of their rake teeth looked like scratches on skin.
The soft-handed clerk stood behind him, silent, waiting. His ring flashed whenever he moved, a reminder of a station bought and maintained.
“Cassian escaped Shrine Town,” the clerk said at last. “He’s returning.”
Marcellus swirled wine in his cup, uninterested in the wine. “Good.”
The clerk frowned, a small crack in his practiced calm. “Good, sir? He’s—he’s disruptive.”
Marcellus laughed softly. “Disruption is useful. It makes men beg for someone to restore the pattern.”
The clerk hesitated. “We could still arrange his death. Cleanly. A knife in an alley—”
Marcellus turned and looked at him. The smile remained. The eyes did not. “You think you can keep a knife clean after you use it? That’s why you’ll always be a clerk.”
The clerk’s throat worked. “Then… what do we do?”
Marcellus lifted his cup slightly, as if toasting the arena. “We let him live. We let him win. We let him think he’s defying us.”
“And the crowd?”
Marcellus’ smile widened. “The crowd is a mouth. We give it a taste of chaos. Then we offer it order like bread.”
The clerk nodded slowly, understanding with visible reluctance. “A riot, then. A purge.”
Marcellus’ voice stayed gentle. “Restoration.”
He turned back to the arena. Below, the sand was almost perfectly smooth again.
Marcellus whispered, to himself, as if it were a private joke:
“Let him be brave.”
SCENE 8 — THE NIGHT BEFORE NOON BLOOD (between Episodes 11 and 12)
The ink-stained man copied the ledger by lamplight in a room that smelled like wet stone.
His hands moved quickly, practiced. He didn’t read for pleasure. He read for survival.
He copied only what mattered: the names with weight. The amounts that proved intent. The seal impressions drawn carefully in wax rubbings.
Outside, Ridge City coughed in its sleep.
When he finished, he heated a small stick of wax and pressed his own seal into the corner—not to claim it, but to mark it as real. A signature that said: if this is questioned, blood will answer.
He wrapped the page and stepped into the alley, hood up, breath steaming faintly in the night.
A figure waited at the end of the lane. Not a soldier. Not a priest. Someone in plain cloth, face turned away from the lantern. Ordinary on purpose.
The ink-stained man held the package out. “Half now.”
The figure placed coins into his palm without looking at his face. The coins were warm, as if they’d been held close to a body.
“And the other half?” the ink-stained man asked.
“When the city burns,” the figure replied softly.
The ink-stained man swallowed. “Whose city?”
The figure’s head tilted. In the low light, the ring on their finger flashed—fine, clean, official.
The ink-stained man’s stomach dropped. “Ah,” he whispered.
The figure took the package and disappeared into the street like it had never existed.
The ink-stained man stood alone for a moment, coins cutting into his skin, realizing he’d just sold a weapon to someone who didn’t intend to be the one holding it when it went off.
SCENE 9 — AFTERMATH: THE SERVICE GATE (after Episode 12)
They hid in a back room above a butcher’s shop where the floorboards always smelled faintly of old fat.
Cassian sat on a crate and sharpened his blade slowly, not because it needed it, but because his hands needed something simple to do.
Varro paced. He stopped and started and stopped again like a man trying to decide whether to confess or flee.
Moth sat in the corner with bread in his lap, staring at it like eating would admit he was alive and therefore still vulnerable.
Iona stood near the window, watching torchlight drift through streets below. Her face was in shadow, but Cassian could feel her attention like pressure.
Varro finally spoke. “I can fix this.”
Cassian didn’t look up. “You can’t fix what was built to be broken.”
Varro’s voice cracked. “I can fix you leaving. After tomorrow.”
Cassian paused the sharpening. “By giving me to someone else.”
Varro flinched. “By getting you out.”
Moth’s voice came out thin. “They’ll just find him.”
Iona murmured, “They already have.”
Cassian set the blade down and looked at Varro. “Tell me the truth. Not the one that makes you sleep. The one that makes you sick.”
Varro swallowed hard. “Marcellus offered me protection for the house. He offered me—” He stopped, shame coloring his cheeks. “—a place. A pension. Quiet.”
Cassian’s eyes narrowed. “And you took it.”
Varro nodded once, small. “I did.”
Moth stared at Varro like he’d been struck.
Iona’s voice was steady, but cold. “And what did you trade?”
Varro’s shoulders sagged. “Time. I traded time.”
Cassian understood. Varro hadn’t sold Cassian outright. He’d sold the distance between danger and impact. He’d moved the knife closer and told himself it wasn’t his hand.
Cassian stood. The room creaked. The butcher’s smell rose around them like truth.
“I’m not asking you to be a hero,” Cassian said. “I’m asking you to choose.”
Varro’s eyes shone. “I don’t know how.”
Cassian stepped close and placed his palm on Varro’s chest, feeling the frantic heart beneath. “Then choose the thing you’ll be able to live with when you’re old and you don’t have anyone left to blame.”
Varro’s breath hitched.
In the corner, Moth tore his bread in half and offered the larger piece to Cassian without speaking.
Cassian took it and ate slowly, jaw tight, eyes fixed on the window where the arena’s torches made the night flicker like a warning.
Tomorrow, the city would ask for a story.
Cassian intended to give it one it couldn’t digest cleanly.
Smoke made the world smaller.
Cassian ran with it in his lungs, in his hair, in the folds of his clothing. The city’s noise was behind him—shouts, bells, the roar of the arena turning into the crackle of fire.
Varro led them through service alleys where servants dumped waste and pretended not to see blood. His knowledge of the city wasn’t noble. It was practical—the kind you gain by living near other men’s appetites.
At a narrow gate set into a wall, Varro stopped. “This way.”
Moth peered through a crack. “There’s a patrol.”
Varro’s face tightened. “I’ll talk.”
Cassian grabbed his sleeve. “You’ll die.”
Varro met Cassian’s eyes, and for the first time all season, his gaze held without flinching. “Maybe. But I can die with my hands clean for once.”
He stepped into the open.
The patrol captain looked up, startled to see a trainer alone, sweating, ash-streaked. “You,” the captain said, suspicion sharpening his voice.
Varro lifted both hands. “I have information,” he panted. “About Cassian. About where he went.”
The captain’s eyes narrowed. “Speak.”
Varro’s voice broke at the edge, then steadied. “He went toward the river gate. He’s trying to leave by the main road.”
The captain barked an order. Boots moved. Lanterns swung.
Varro stood still, letting the lie become real in their heads.
Behind the wall, Cassian watched Varro’s silhouette, throat tight, as if gratitude were a thing he didn’t know how to swallow.
Iona touched Cassian’s arm once—light, brief. A reminder not to freeze.
They slipped through the narrow gate and ran.
From behind them, Varro’s voice rose—loud now, angry, theatrical. “He’s making fools of you! He’s—”
A shout cut him off. A thud. Silence.
Cassian kept running.
He hated himself for it.
He loved Varro for it.
Ahead, the road opened into dark fields, and the city’s fire painted the clouds orange like a wound that refused to close.
END OF DOCUMENT
