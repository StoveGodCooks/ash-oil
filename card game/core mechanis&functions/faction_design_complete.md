# Complete Faction Design - AEGIS | ECLIPSE | SPECTER

> **Version:** V1 Locked  
> **Scope:** Full faction designs including base stats, faction bonuses, status synergies, 15-card kits, and counter-play dynamics

---

## Design Philosophy

### The Triangle
- **AEGIS** (Tank) → Counters ECLIPSE → Weak to SPECTER
- **ECLIPSE** (Assassin) → Counters SPECTER → Weak to AEGIS
- **SPECTER** (Control) → Counters AEGIS → Weak to ECLIPSE

### Balance Pillars
1. **Stat identity** - Each faction has clear strengths/weaknesses in HP/Armor/Speed/Damage
2. **Status mastery** - Each faction excels with 2 status effects, resists 1, vulnerable to 1
3. **Playstyle clarity** - Tank vs Burst vs Control should feel distinct
4. **Counter-play hooks** - Each faction has exploitable weaknesses

# FACTION 1: AEGIS (The Fortress)

## Identity
The unstoppable wall. AEGIS survives through high HP, armor generation, and converting defensive momentum into sustain. Slow but inexorable.

## Base Stats
- **HP:** 30
- **Armor:** 5
- **Speed:** 2
- **Damage:** 4

## Faction Bonus: "FORTRESS"
**Effect:** Whenever you gain Armor, restore HP equal to 30% of the Armor gained (rounded down).
- Gain 5 Armor → Restore 1 HP
- Gain 10 Armor → Restore 3 HP

**Design intent:** Rewards stacking armor effects. Converts defense into sustain without needing healing cards.

## Status Synergies
- **Masters:** Armor (stacking/refreshing), applying Weakened (reduces incoming damage)
- **Resists:** Bleeding (high HP pool absorbs it), Poison (can outheal it)
- **Vulnerable to:** Enraged (amplifies their low base damage against you)

## Card Philosophy
- High-cost, high-impact defensive plays
- Cards that gain armor AND do something else (attack, weaken, card draw)
- Few attacks, but they're efficient when you have armor up
- Lacks burst damage and speed

# FACTION MATCHUP MATRIX

## AEGIS vs ECLIPSE
**AEGIS favored (65/35)**
- AEGIS armor counters ECLIPSE burst
- AEGIS Weakened stacks neuter ECLIPSE damage
- ECLIPSE lacks tools to strip armor efficiently
- ECLIPSE's low HP means they die before breaking through
- **ECLIPSE win condition:** Apply max Bleeding early, burst before armor scales

## ECLIPSE vs SPECTER
**ECLIPSE favored (60/40)**
- ECLIPSE speed + burst kills SPECTER before poison scales
- ECLIPSE Enraged ignores Weakened stacks (risk/reward)
- SPECTER lacks healing to survive burst
- **SPECTER win condition:** Survive opening burst, max Weakened + Poison, outlast

## SPECTER vs AEGIS
**SPECTER favored (65/35)**
- Poison ignores Armor (goes straight to HP)
- Plague Touch scales vs AEGIS high HP
- Weakened stacks reduce AEGIS pressure
- AEGIS lacks burst to end before poison scales
- **AEGIS win condition:** Rush with Crushing Blow/Counter Strike, finish before poison critical mass

# DESIGN VALIDATION CHECKLIST

## Each faction has:
✅ Clear identity (Tank / Assassin / Control)  
✅ Distinct stat profile (high HP vs high damage vs balanced)  
✅ Unique faction bonus (Fortress / Bloodlust / Miasma)  
✅ 2 status masteries, 1 resist, 1 vulnerability  
✅ 15 cards spanning starter → ultimate  
✅ Clear win condition and playstyle  
✅ Exploitable weaknesses for counterplay  
✅ 60/40 to 65/35 favorable/unfavorable matchups  

## Balance confirms:
✅ No faction autowins any matchup  
✅ Each faction has comeback mechanics (Bulwark / Vital Strike / Virulence)  
✅ Each faction has skill expression (combo sequencing, risk/reward)  
✅ Status effects matter (not just stats)  
✅ Gear can shift matchups (TBD in gear design)  

---

# NEXT STEPS

1. **Lock status effect numbers** (Bleeding tick damage, Poison duration, Armor decay, etc.)
2. **Lock combat rules** (turn order, resource system, damage calc)
3. **Design gear system** (20-24 pieces with faction synergies)
4. **Build balance spreadsheet** (consolidate all numbers)
5. **Playtest simulation** (math out key matchups)

---

**Document Status:** ✅ LOCKED - Ready for implementation  
**Last Updated:** V1 Initial  
**Next Review:** After status effects + combat rules locked
