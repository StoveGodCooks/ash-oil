📜 Card Game – Dynamic Contract Board System (v0.1 LOCKED)
Purpose

The Contract Board must:

React to player decisions

Reflect party condition and relationship state

Escalate unresolved problems

Deliver meaningful gameplay hooks

Stay modular and expandable

No ambient fluff. No static listings.
The board is generated fresh each hub visit.

1️⃣ Board Structure

Each hub visit generates:

1 Main Contract Slot (if unlocked by story spine)

3 Side Contract Slots

1 Rival Contract Slot (conditional)

If Rival Contract is active:

It replaces one Side slot

Total visible contracts remain 4

Side contracts expire on departure.
Main contracts persist until completed.

2️⃣ Board Signals (Input Data)

Each hub visit collects signals from game state:

2.1 Progress

Act number

Mission tier

Difficulty scaling factor

2.2 Party Condition

Active injuries (minor/major)

Stress states (Calm / Tense / Frayed / etc.)

Active roster

2.3 Relationship State (Hidden)

Recent bond fracture tags

Trust drop tags

Vow created/broken tags

Grief tags

2.4 Economy

Gold total

Debt burden (if system enabled)

Supply level

2.5 Rival State

Hate Level (1–5)

Vengeance Clock (0–6)

Targeted teammate

Rival Heat score

2.6 Player Pattern Flags (optional but supported)

Frequent retreat

Always prioritizes loot

Avoids certain enemy types

Always protects same teammate

These inputs feed contract generation.

3️⃣ Hook System (Core of Reactivity)

After every expedition, the game generates Hooks.

Hooks represent unresolved consequences that must influence the next board.

Example Hook Types

injury_major: teammateId

injury_minor: teammateId

bond_fracture: A,B

trust_drop: teammateId

vow_created: vowType

vow_broken: vowType

rival_targets: teammateId

loot_dispute

low_supplies

grief_active: teammateId

Hook Rule (Mandatory)

Each hub visit must:

Offer at least 2 contracts that directly resolve active hooks

Escalate hooks that go unresolved multiple visits

Escalation Examples:

Ignored injury → worsens tier

Ignored bond fracture → pairing penalties

Ignored rival target → stronger rival intrusion

Ignored vow break → trust penalty compounds

This guarantees meaning.

4️⃣ Contract Slot Filling Algorithm
Step 1: Gather Signals + Hooks

Collect:

Current hooks[]

Rival clock status

Party state

Step 2: Determine Slots
mainSlot = available if story gate open
sideSlots = 3
if rivalClock == 6:
    rivalSlot = active
    sideSlots = 2

Step 3: Fill Slots by Priority

Priority buckets:

Hook-Resolvers (minimum 2 required)

Build-Enablers (upgrades, economy, synergy)

Risk/Reward Spice (wildcard high variance)

Step 4: Personalization Pass

For each generated contract:

Generate hook-aware flavor line

Attach involved teammates (if relevant)

Scale reward and risk by difficulty tier

Step 5: Expiration & Escalation

Side contracts expire on departure

Unresolved hooks increment escalation counters

Escalation modifies future board weightings

5️⃣ Contract Template Categories

We implement 12 reusable templates grouped into categories.

5.1 Recovery Contracts

Purpose: resolve injury/stress hooks

Examples:

Safe Route Extraction

Field Medic Escort

Defensive Hold

Rewards:

Injury reduction

Stress relief

Minor gold

Risk:

Low–Medium combat

5.2 Power Contracts

Purpose: enable builds

Examples:

Elite Hunt

Rare Relic Retrieval

Champion Trial

Rewards:

Card upgrade

Gear mod

Link card unlock chance

Risk:

High combat pressure

5.3 Relationship Contracts

Purpose: resolve bond/trust hooks

Examples:

Forced Pairing Assignment

Personal Errand

Mediation Run

Rewards:

Bond repair

Trust boost

Unique synergy unlock

Risk:

Mid difficulty

Narrative consequence if failed

5.4 Economy Contracts

Purpose: gold/supply/debt management

Examples:

Supply Convoy

High-Risk Bounty

Salvage Sweep

Rewards:

Gold

Supplies

Debt reduction

Risk:

Injury risk modifier

Timed pressure

5.5 Rival Contracts (Triggered Only)

Trigger Condition:

if vengeanceClock == 6


Variants:

Intercept (fight rival’s unit)

Bait (reward trap)

Rescue (rival targeted teammate)

Rival contract replaces 1 side slot.

If ignored:

Rival Heat increases

Next intrusion stronger

6️⃣ Hook Escalation Rules

Each hook tracks escalationLevel.

If ignored:

escalationLevel++

Escalation impacts:

Contract difficulty

Penalties

Forced events

Hard cap recommended: escalationLevel 3

7️⃣ What Player Sees

Each contract shows:

Title

Hook Line (dynamic, state-aware)

Reward Tags (Upgrade / Heal / Gold / Link / Supply)

Risk Tags (Elite / Timed / Injury Risk / Rival Presence)

Involved Teammates (portrait icons)

NO numbers exposed for trust/bond.

8️⃣ Design Constraints

Minimum 2 hook-resolving contracts per board

Max 1 rival contract per board

Max total contracts visible: 4

System must be modular

Templates must be data-driven

9️⃣ Expandability

Future versions can add:

Additional hook types

New contract templates

Seasonal/Act-specific contract pools

Special faction-exclusive contracts

Additional ending integration hooks

The board system must allow insertion of new categories without rewriting generation logic.
