GAP 9: Synergy Card Details Missing ⚠️

What We Need:
VETERAN SIGNATURE CARDS (9 Total - 3 per faction)

Current State:

Concept defined (Refinement 15)
No actual medals designed

What We Need:

🔧 FINAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
Improvement 1: Resource Generation Needs Tuning
Current:

+3 Stamina/turn (fixed)
+1 Mana/turn + 1/card played + 1/5 damage taken
May be too fast or too slow

Test Needed:

Can you play 2-3 cards/turn consistently? (Goal: yes)
Can you afford abilities by Turn 3-4? (Goal: yes for Ability 1, Turn 5-6 for Ability 2)
Do late turns feel flooded with resources? (Goal: no, should stay tight)

Action: Run simulation, tune generation rates

Improvement 2: Multi-Target Balance Unclear
Current:

AoE cards exist (Phalanx, Toxic Cloud)
No clear power budget vs single-target

Question:

Should "Deal 5 damage to all" (15 total) cost same as "Deal 15 to one"?
Or should AoE be less efficient per-target?

Proposal:

AoE = 60-70% efficiency of single-target
"Deal 10 to one" (2 Stamina) vs "Deal 4 to all" (2 Stamina, 12 total if 3 enemies)
Balances AoE power without making it useless

Action: Define AoE cost multiplier rule

Improvement 3: Turn Timing Cap Needed
Current:

No turn limit
Games could go 20+ turns (stalemate)

Proposal:
TURN LIMIT: 15 turns
After Turn 15:
- All units take 5% max HP damage per turn (both sides)
- "The battle drags on, exhaustion sets in"
- Forces aggression, prevents infinite stall

OR

FATIGUE SYSTEM:
- Turn 10+: All cards cost +1 Stamina
- Turn 15+: All units lose 1 HP/turn
- Forces eventual resolution
Action: Decide turn limit/fatigue system

Improvement 4: Retreat Consequences Undefined
Current:

Retreat = keep rewards, injured units risk Grave injury (50%)
May be too punishing or too generous

Questions:

Should retreat cost gold?
Should retreat fail the mission permanently?
Should retreat have a "retreat counter" (3 retreats = campaign loss)?

Proposal:
RETREAT MECHANICS:
- Keep gold/gear earned so far (as designed)
- All knocked out units: 50% Grave injury risk (as designed)
- Mission marked FAILED (cannot retry for better rewards)
- NEW: Retreat count tracked (3 retreats in 10 missions = Warning: "Morale low")
- If 5 retreats: Campaign difficulty increases permanently (+10% enemy stats)
Action: Define exact retreat mechanics and consequences

Improvement 5: Faction Balance Verification
Current:

Rock-paper-scissors designed (AEGIS > ECLIPSE > SPECTER > AEGIS)
Target: 60/40 to 65/35 matchups
Not validated with actual numbers

Test Needed:

Simulate 100 fights: AEGIS vs ECLIPSE
Simulate 100 fights: ECLIPSE vs SPECTER
Simulate 100 fights: SPECTER vs AEGIS
Validate win rates match targets

Action: Run faction matchup simulations, tune HP/damage if needed

Improvement 6: Card Upgrade System Missing
Current:

Cards can be "upgraded" (mentioned in design)
No upgrade mechanic defined

Proposal:
CARD UPGRADE SYSTEM (Hub Service)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FORGE (Unlock Mission 3)
Upgrade cards for permanent improvements.

Examples:
- Shield Bash → Shield Bash+
  - Before: 5 damage, 3 Armor (1 Stamina)
  - After: 7 damage, 4 Armor (1 Stamina)
  
- Slash → Slash+
  - Before: 6 damage, Bleeding 1 (1 Stamina)
  - After: 8 damage, Bleeding 2 (1 Stamina)

Cost: 50-100 gold per upgrade
Limit: Can upgrade same card multiple times (Slash → Slash+ → Slash++)
Max upgrade: +2 tiers

Visual: Card shows "+" or "++" suffix
Action: Define upgrade costs and effect increases for all 55 cards

Improvement 7: Mission Failure Consequences Vague
Current:

Retreat = mission failed
What happens if all units die mid-mission?

Proposal:
MISSION FAILURE OUTCOMES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RETREAT (Player choice):
- Keep rewards earned
- Injured units risk Grave injury
- Mission marked failed

TOTAL PARTY WIPE (All 3 units knocked out):
- Keep 50% of rewards earned
- ALL units gain 1 Serious injury (severe consequence)
- Forced return to hub
- Mission available to retry (but no rewards for waves already cleared)

Campaign continues (no permadeath).
But wipe = very costly (3 Serious injuries to heal).
Action: Define exact wipe consequences

Improvement 8: Boss Loot Table Missing
Current:

Bosses drop "better loot"
No exact table

Proposal:
BOSS LOOT TABLES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Early Boss (Mission 2, 4):
- Gold: 50-80
- Gear: 1 Common guaranteed + 1 Rare (30% chance)
- Card: Unlock 1 new card for your faction

Mid Boss (Mission 5, 7):
- Gold: 80-120
- Gear: 1 Rare guaranteed + 1 Epic (20% chance)
- Card: Unlock 1 new card OR upgrade token

Late Boss (Mission 8, 9):
- Gold: 120-180
- Gear: 1 Rare + 1 Epic (50% chance)
- Card: Unlock 1 Epic card OR 2 upgrade tokens

Final Boss (Mission 10):
- Gold: 200
- Gear: 1 Epic guaranteed + 1 Epic (second roll, 50%)
- Card: Unlock all remaining cards for your faction
- Special: Campaign victory screen, stats summary
Action: Create exact loot tables for all boss encounters

Define 8 enemy archetypes - I'll create stat blocks
Lock starting decks - I'll specify exact 19-22 cards per faction combo
Define AoE efficiency - Let's decide 60% or 70%?
Confirm resources - Keep 3 Stamina/turn, 0 start Mana, +1/turn+card?

Step 2: Design Mission Suite (Tomorrow)

Create 10 missions with exact enemy wave breakdowns
Define boss loot tables
Balance economy across 10 missions

Step 3: Add New Cards (Day 3)

Design 10 synergy cards
Design 9 veteran signatures
Design 15 injury medals

Step 4: Build Simulator (Day 4-5)

Run 100+ simulations
Validate balance

Step 5: Polish Pass (Day 6-7)

Tutorial mission
UI/UX documentation
Final tweaks based on simulation data


❓ DECISION POINTS FOR YOU

Option B: 70% efficiency (Deal 5 to all = 15 total vs 10 to one)
Option C: Same efficiency (Deal 10 to all = 30 total vs 10 to one) [Very strong]

Q2: Turn Limit?

Option A: No limit (games can go 20+ turns)
Option B: 15 turn limit with fatigue damage
Option C: 20 turn limit with fatigue

Q3: Retreat Limit?

Option A: Unlimited retreats (but consequences per retreat)
Option B: 3 retreats per campaign (hard limit)
Option C: 5 retreats, but each increases difficulty

Q4: Starting Mana?

Option A: 0 Mana (abilities Turn 3-4)
Option B: 2 Mana (abilities Turn 2-3)
Option C: 3 Mana (abilities Turn 1-2) [Too fast?]

Tell me your choices and I'll lock the system!
