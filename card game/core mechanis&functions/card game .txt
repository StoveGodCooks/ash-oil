# Game Design Document: Tactical Card Expedition Game

## Core Concept
A single-player card-based tactical game combining Legends of Runeterra's combat mechanics with XCOM's strategic depth and Expeditions: Rome's mission structure. Players lead a champion and their lieutenants through multi-encounter expeditions where decisions, resource management, and unit survival create meaningful strategic gameplay.

---

## Game Pillars

### 1. Meaningful Progression
- Multi-encounter missions that feel like real expeditions, not single-fight errands
- "Expeditions of Rome meets XCOM" - substantial operations with weight and consequence
- No constant hub bouncing - commit to full missions with escalating stakes

### 2. Strategic Depth Over Graphics
- Card game format allows deep mechanics without heavy graphics requirements
- Complex systems and tactical decisions are the core appeal
- Gameplay richness compensates for visual limitations

### 3. Attachment to Units
- Named heroes with progression systems
- Injury consequences create emotional investment
- Veteran units become irreplaceable through experience and story

### 4. Challenging But Fair
- Hard but beatable difficulty scaling
- Clear telegraphing and player agency
- NOT Darkest Dungeon brutal - challenging without being punishing
- Players should lose due to decisions, not RNG or unfair mechanics

## Combat System

### Core Mechanics
- **Legends of Runeterra-style card combat**
  - Alternating action system (back-and-forth play)
  - Unit positioning on board matters
  - Units persist between turns and can be buffed/damaged
  - Tactical without requiring complex grid movement

### Unit Composition
- **1 Main Champion** - Player's avatar, cannot permanently die
- **3-4 Lieutenant Slots** - Named heroes with unique abilities
- **Total Roster: 6-8 units** - Allows rotation when units need recovery

### Unit Progression
- Survive missions → gain XP → unlock new cards/abilities
- Each lieutenant has skill tree or card unlock path
- Veterans become genuinely powerful
- Higher level units add more powerful cards to deck pool OR provide passive benefits

## Mission Structure

### Expedition Format
Each mission consists of **4-6 consecutive encounters**:

**Wave 1-2: Scouts/Light Enemies**
- Warm-up encounters
- Establish tactical positioning
- Minimal resource drain

**Wave 3-4: Main Force**
- Primary challenge
- Significant resource drain
- Tests player strategy

**Wave 5-6: Elite/Boss**
- Climactic encounter
- Special mechanics and telegraphed attacks
- Multiple phases possible

### Between-Encounter Decision Points

After each encounter, players choose:

**Push Forward** (no rest)
- Keep momentum, enemies don't reinforce
- Injuries/HP stay as-is
- Faster mission completion
- High risk

**Quick Breather** (short rest)
- Heal 30% HP on all units
- Remove 1 minor status effect per unit
- Enemies may regroup/reinforce
- Costs 1 supply

**Full Rest** (camp)
- Heal 70% HP
- Use healing cards/abilities
- May trigger random event (ambush, find loot, morale boost)
- Enemy gets stronger for final encounter
- Costs 2 supplies

**Strategic Retreat** (abandon mission)
- Keep loot from completed encounters
- All knocked out units risk grave injury (dice roll)
- Mission failure consequences
- "XCOM evac" moment

## Injury System

### Two-Track Health System

**HP (Combat Health)**
- Your combat health during encounters
- Regenerates partially (30-50%) between encounters within same mission
- Drop to 0 HP = knocked out for rest of that encounter
- Can use healing cards/abilities during combat

**Injury Track (Real Damage)**
- Separate from HP - represents lasting harm
- Does NOT automatically heal between encounters

### When Injuries Occur
- HP drops to 0 (knocked out = minimum 1 injury)
- Critical hits from enemies
- Failing to block devastating attacks
- Environmental hazards
- Taking damage while already at low HP

### Injury Severity Levels

**Minor Wounds** (heal naturally over time)
- Examples:
  - Bruised ribs: -1 HP for next mission
  - Strained arm: One random card costs +1 this mission
  - Dazed: Draw -1 card first turn
- Healing: Goes away after sitting out 1-2 missions OR basic medical resources

**Serious Injuries** (require resources + time)
- Examples:
  - Broken leg: Can't use movement cards effectively
  - Deep cut: Lose 1 HP per turn until treated
  - Concussion: 50% chance to discard random card each turn
- Healing: Need medic/supplies/gold to treat, takes multiple missions

**Grave Injuries** (permanent scars)
- Examples:
  - Lost eye: -1 to ranged attack cards permanently
  - Bad knee: -2 max stamina forever
  - Shattered ribs: Starts each mission with -2 HP
  - Nerve damage: One random card type costs +1 permanently
- **NEVER FULLY HEAL** - permanent consequence of reckless play

### Injury Escalation

**Finish mission with 1-2 injuries:**
- Minor wounds, heal normally

**Finish with 3+ injuries OR get injured while already wounded:**
- Risk grave injury
- Game warns: "⚠️ Lt. Marcus is badly wounded. Deploying him again risks permanent injury."

**Player choice:**
- Rest veteran (lose their power for missions) OR risk permanent damage
- Creates meaningful strategic decisions

### Injury Warning System

Game provides explicit warnings:
- "⚠️ Lt. Marcus: 2 injuries, low HP - another knockdown risks GRAVE INJURY"
- "⚠️ Warning: 3 units injured - retreating now may be wise"
- Players make informed risk vs reward decisions

## Difficulty Scaling

### Philosophy
- **Hard but predictable** - Losses from decisions, not RNG
- **Clear telegraphing** - Players can see dangers coming
- **Comeback mechanics** - Getting behind ≠ unwinnable spiral
- **Player agency** - Choose your challenge level

### Target Metrics
- **60-70% mission success rate** - Sweet spot between boring and frustrating
- **Most missions should be "close calls"** not "easy stomps" or "brutal wipes"

### Injury Rate Targets
- 1-2 minor injuries per mission = normal
- 0 injuries = excellent execution, player feels good
- 3+ injuries = warning signs, time to adjust strategy
- Grave injuries = rare, result of ignoring multiple warnings

### Mission Difficulty Tiers

Players choose mission difficulty before deployment:

**EASY ⭐** (Tutorial/Recovery missions)
- 3 encounters, weak enemies
- Good for training new recruits
- Lower rewards
- Example: "Bandit Raid" - disorganized enemies

**MEDIUM ⭐⭐** (Standard progression)
- 4-5 encounters
- Mixed enemy types
- Standard rewards
- Example: "Enemy Patrol" - organized resistance

**HARD ⭐⭐⭐** (Veteran squads)
- 5-6 encounters, elite enemies
- High injury risk
- Great rewards
- Example: "Fortified Position" - prepared enemies

**EXTREME ⭐⭐⭐⭐** (Optional challenges)
- 6+ encounters, brutal difficulty
- Expect injuries
- Legendary loot
- Example: "Enemy Stronghold" - extreme danger

**Key principle:** Players never forced into unfair fights

### Progressive Campaign Difficulty

**Act 1 (Missions 1-10): Learning Phase**
- Injuries are rarer
- Enemies telegraph clearly
- Easier to retreat successfully
- Generous healing resources
- Goal: Learn systems without punishment

**Act 2 (Missions 11-25): Challenge Ramps**
- Enemies hit harder
- More complex encounter design
- Injuries more common but manageable
- Resources tighten slightly
- Goal: Master tactics and resource management

**Act 3 (Missions 26+): Expert Play**
- Assumes system mastery
- Creative enemy combinations
- Injury management critical
- Resource optimization required
- Goal: Execute perfect strategy

**Important:** Even in Act 3, medium difficulty missions available for recovery/training

### Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (Behind-the-Scenes)

**Track player performance:**
- Win rate on missions
- Average injuries per mission
- Resource accumulation rate
- Retreat frequency

**If player struggling:**
- Slightly reduce enemy damage (5-10%)
- Increase loot/resource drops
- Offer easier mission options
- Give more healing between encounters

**If player crushing:**
- Enemies get slightly smarter AI
- More aggressive enemy compositions
- Better rewards for harder missions

**Critical:** This should be invisible - players shouldn't feel patronized

### Injury Recovery Balance

**Generous recovery options:**
- Natural healing is FREE, just takes time (2-3 missions)
- Medical treatment reasonably priced (not punitive)
- Always have backup units available
- Starting roster: 6-8 units for 4 deployment slots = room for rotation

**Avoiding Darkest Dungeon's mistakes:**
- Injuries are setbacks, not disasters
- Can always field competent team
- Healing resources are available
- Grave injuries rare (only from reckless play)

### Enemy Design for Fair Challenge

**Telegraphed Danger:**
- "⚠️ Enemy Berserker preparing MASSIVE STRIKE (8 damage) - blocks recommended"
- "🎯 Archer targeting Lt. Kira (wounded) - 70% hit chance"
- Show what's coming so players can respond

**Counterplay Always Exists:**
- Every dangerous enemy has weakness
- Block cards reduce damage
- Positioning matters
- CC/debuffs are valuable
- Players never helpless

**Stat-Based Scaling (NOT BS Mechanics):**
- Later enemies have more HP/damage (visible numbers)
- NOT: "This enemy ignores all defenses"
- NOT: "Random chance to permanently wound"

### Hidden Safety Mechanics

**Death Protection** (first time per mission)
- First time unit would die/get grave injury = survives with serious injuries instead
- Players don't know this exists
- Prevents one mistake from destroying veteran

**Clutch Moments**
- When dire, slightly increase chance for good card draws
- Not noticeable, just gives fighting chance

**Resource Floor**
- Can't get stuck unable to progress
- Always at least one free/cheap healing option
- Basic starter units always available

### Player Agency in Difficulty

**Optional Modifiers at Mission Start:**
- "Deploy with -1 unit for +50% rewards"
- "Enemies stronger but drop better loot"
- "Permadeath enabled this mission (hardcore mode)"

Let players push themselves when ready

### Feedback and Learning

**Post-Mission Breakdown:**
- "Lt. Marcus took 45 damage this mission - consider more defensive cards"
- "You used 3 healing cards - enemy type X hits hard, prepare better"
- "Perfect mission! No injuries sustained"

Help players understand and improve

## Example Mission Flow

### Mission Start
- 4 units deploy: Main Champion + 3 Lieutenants, all fresh

### Encounter 1 (Scouts)
- Easy fight
- Lt. Kira takes some damage but no injuries
- **Decision Point:** Push forward or quick rest?

### Encounter 2 (Ambush)
- Harder fight
- Lt. Marcus knocked out → gains "Sprained Ankle" injury
- Lt. Kira hit hard, low HP
- **Decision Point:** Push (Marcus limping, Kira vulnerable) or full rest (enemies fortify)?

### Player Chooses: Quick Rest
- Marcus still has Sprained Ankle (-1 movement)
- Kira back to 60% HP
- Enemies ahead warned of approach

### Encounter 3 (Main Force)
- Tough fight, damage spread around
- Lt. Kira knocked out → gains "Sword Slash" injury (now 2 injuries total)
- Champion takes damage but survives
- **⚠️ NEW WARNING:** "Lt. Kira gravely wounded - another injury becomes permanent"

### Critical Decision Point
Options:
- Push to final boss with Kira at risk?
- Full rest but final boss gets stronger?
- Retreat and take the loss?

### Player Chooses: Push Forward (Risky)

### Encounter 4 (Boss)
- Play carefully, keep Kira in back
- Lt. Marcus takes hits, gets knocked out → 2nd injury
- **WIN** but barely

### Mission End Results
- **Lt. Kira:** 2 injuries, needs medical attention (3 missions OR costs resources)
- **Lt. Marcus:** 2 injuries, same situation
- **If mission lost:** Kira's injuries would have become permanent grave injury

### Post-Mission Hub
**Medical Tent Options:**
- Pay 50 gold → heal Kira in 1 mission instead of 3
- Let her rest naturally (unavailable 3 missions)
- Deploy her anyway next mission (RISK grave injury)

## Tension Sources

The game creates tension through:

1. **Multi-unit injury management** across multiple encounters
2. **Rest vs push decisions** with real consequences
3. **Veteran power vs fragility** - strong but vulnerable
4. **Resource allocation** - healing vs upgrading
5. **Roster rotation** when veterans need recovery
6. **Escalating stakes** within each expedition
7. **Clear warnings** that let players knowingly take risks

---

## Key Design Principles

### What Makes This Different

**Not Darkest Dungeon:**
- Challenging but not punishing
- Generous recovery systems
- Clear feedback and warnings
- No death spirals

**Not Standard Deck Builder:**
- Multi-encounter expeditions
- Unit persistence and injury management
- Squad-based rather than pure solo hero

**Not Full Tactics Game:**
- Card-based combat keeps complexity manageable
- No complex grid movement
- Focus on card synergies and deck building

### Core Player Experience

Players should feel:
- **Strategic mastery** through good decision-making
- **Attachment to units** through progression and scars
- **Meaningful choices** at every decision point
- **Fair challenge** - hard but beatable
- **Progression** both within missions and across campaign
- **Stories emerging** from veteran units with battle scars
