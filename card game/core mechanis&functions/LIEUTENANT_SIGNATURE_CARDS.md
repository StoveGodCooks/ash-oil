## CARD DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Key Principle:** Signature cards work for ANY unit but provide bonus effects if played by the correct lieutenant.

**Example:**
```
VETERAN'S RESOLVE (Marcus Signature)
Cost: 1 Stamina
Effect: Gain 4 Armor. If played by Marcus, draw 1 card.

Usage:
- Play by Champion: Gain 4 Armor (solid defensive card)
- Play by Marcus: Gain 4 Armor + draw 1 card (card advantage!)
- Play by Livia: Gain 4 Armor (works, but no bonus)
```

**Unlock Progression:**
- Common (1 per lieutenant): Unlocked at recruitment
- Rare (1 per lieutenant): Unlocked at Level 3
- Epic (1 per lieutenant): Unlocked at Level 6

## DECK BUILDING INTEGRATION

### How Signature Cards Unlock

**Common (Recruitment):**
- Unlock when you recruit that lieutenant
- Example: Recruit Marcus → Unlock "Veteran's Resolve"
- Available immediately for next mission

**Rare (Level 3):**
- Unlock when lieutenant reaches Level 3
- Example: Marcus reaches Level 3 → Unlock "Legion Tactics"
- Takes ~3-4 missions of active play

**Epic (Level 6):**
- Unlock when lieutenant reaches Level 6
- Example: Marcus reaches Level 6 → Unlock "Disciplined Veteran"
- End-game cards (only available late Season 1)

### Adding to Shared Deck

Once unlocked, signature cards are added to the shared deck's card pool:
- Player can include them in any build
- Not mandatory (player chooses to include or exclude)
- Can use Marcus cards even if Marcus isn't in active squad
- Deck limit: Uncommon unlimited, Rare max 3, Epic max 2 (same as other cards)

### Card Synergy Examples

**Signature + Original Cards:**
```
Marcus "Veteran's Resolve" (draw if Marcus) + Original "Swift Draw" (draw 1)
→ Marcus plays both = 2 cards drawn (good combo)

Livia "Blessed Strike" (Poison 2 if Livia) + Original "Plague Burst" (damage = Poison x2)
→ Livia uses both = Poison stacks fast, high damage payoff

Thane "Gladiator's Championship" (Enraged 3, no downside if Thane) + Original "Reckless Strike" (exploit Enraged)
→ Thane goes full aggressive, 2 attacks at +50% each

Julia "Unbreakable Spirit" (heal if Julia) + Original "Sanctuary" (heal + Armor)
→ Julia is full support, keeps entire squad alive
```
