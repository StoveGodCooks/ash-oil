## 🎯 GEAR PHILOSOPHY (UPDATED)

### Design Pillars:
1. **Champion feels special** — Full modular gear with individual armor pieces (helm, chest, feet)
2. **Lieutenants simpler** — Outfit system (pre-made armor set) + accessories for customization
3. **Balance maintained** — More accessible for lieutenants, more expensive for champion
4. **Build variety** — Accessories enable different playstyles across whole squad
5. **Clean inventory** — Champion 8 slots, Lieutenants 4 slots each (manageable)

## OUTFIT DESIGN DETAILS

### What Is An "Outfit"?

**Definition:** A single armor piece that represents a complete outfit (helm + chest + feet combined). Provides only stat bonuses, no special effects.

**Why Outfits?**
- Lieutenants feel like a unified squad (matching outfit aesthetic)
- Simpler than modular pieces (1 slot instead of 3)
- Still customizable via 2 accessories
- Easier to balance (single stat package)

**Outfit Mechanics:**
- Equip one outfit per lieutenant
- Can swap at hub before missions
- Cannot change mid-combat
- Stat bonuses stack with accessories + weapon

**Example Loadout - Marcus:**
```
Weapon: Poisoned Dagger (+2 Damage, apply Poison 1)
Outfit: Assassin's Leathers (+1 Speed, +4 HP, +1 Poison damage)
Accessory 1: Ring of Swiftness (+2 Speed bonus)
Accessory 2: Vial of Focus (+1 Mana start)

Result: Marcus is fast, mobile, Poison-focused lieutenant
```

## INTEGRATION WITH SQUAD COMBAT

### How Gear Affects Squad:

**Champion Gear:**
- Only Champion wears helm/chest/feet
- Champion's weapon determines damage output
- Accessories can buff whole squad or individual units

**Lieutenant Gear:**
- Each lieutenant has their own outfit (defines their armor profile)
- Optional weapons let lieutenants specialize (damage vs tank)
- 2 accessories per lieutenant enable unique builds

**Synergy Example:**
```
SQUAD COMPOSITION:
Champion: AEGIS with Fortress Guard Helm + Warrior's Plate + Combat Boots + Defensive Accessory
Marcus: ECLIPSE with Lightweight Poison Dagger + Assassin's Leathers + Offensive Accessory + Mana Accessory
Livia: SPECTER with no weapon + Plague Doctor Outfit + Control Accessory + Utility Accessory

Result:
- Champion tanks/defends
- Marcus deals Poison damage
- Livia applies control effects
- All 3 have specialized roles based on gear
```
