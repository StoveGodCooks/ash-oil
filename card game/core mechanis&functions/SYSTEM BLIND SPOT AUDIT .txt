# SYSTEM BLIND SPOT AUDIT  
## Card Game – Structural Review (v1)

This document outlines potential blind spots discovered during a full-system audit.  
These are not criticisms — they are pressure-test points meant to strengthen the design before scaling.

---

# 1️⃣ Combat System Blind Spots

## 1.1 Mana Tempo Compression

### Risk:
Mana generation currently scales from:
- +1 passive per turn
- +1 per card played (up to +2)
- +1 per 5 damage taken
- Accessories and gear modifiers
- Faction interactions (e.g., Enraged builds)

In optimized builds, Ability 2 (7 Mana) may become accessible too early (Turn 2 in edge cases).

### Why It Matters:
This compresses combat pacing and may trivialize mid-fight tension.

### Recommendation:
- Implement a **hard cap on Mana gained per turn** (e.g., max 4 from sources, excluding passive).
- Monitor Ability 2 timing across all factions in Act 1 and Act 2.

## 1.2 AEGIS Long-Fight Dominance

### Risk:
Armor:
- Does not decay
- Converts to HP (Fortress)
- Can double
- Has cap increases via gear
- Can scale very high in drawn-out fights

AEGIS may become mathematically dominant in long encounters, especially vs non-poison factions.

### Why It Matters:
If long fights favor AEGIS too strongly, faction triangle balance erodes.

### Recommendation:
- Introduce more **Armor Shred mechanics** in Act 2+ enemies.
- Add boss traits that temporarily reduce Armor caps.
- Ensure ECLIPSE and SPECTER have reliable scaling counters.

## 1.3 Poison Exponential Scaling

### Risk:
SPECTER’s Poison:
- Scales passively via Miasma
- Doubles via Plague Mastery
- Deals immediate and over-time damage

In multi-enemy fights, poison can spike extremely high if allowed to stack uncontested.

### Why It Matters:
Late-game builds may default to poison dominance.

### Recommendation:
- Ensure late-game enemies include partial cleanse or poison mitigation.
- Monitor poison cap reach frequency.
- Track whether poison becomes the safest universal strategy.

# 2️⃣ Gear System Blind Spots

## 2.1 Accessory Slot Overload

### Risk:
Accessory slot currently influences:
- Mana generation
- Card draw
- Stamina
- Status scaling
- Tempo acceleration

It carries more systemic weight than weapon or armor slots.

### Why It Matters:
Optimal builds may revolve around accessory selection more than core identity.

### Recommendation:
- Introduce select Weapons or Armor pieces that affect resource flow.
- Slightly redistribute systemic influence away from accessories.

---

# 3️⃣ Faction Triangle Stability

### Current Triangle:
- AEGIS > ECLIPSE
- ECLIPSE > SPECTER
- SPECTER > AEGIS

### Blind Spot:
High-skill players may lean toward SPECTER due to:
- Poison bypassing armor
- Control reducing burst threats
- Exponential scaling

### Recommendation:
- Playtest late-game meta for faction drift.
- Ensure cleanse and disruption mechanics remain relevant at high tiers.

---

# 4️⃣ Contract Board & Hook System

## 4.1 Escalation Legibility

### Risk:
Hooks escalate internally if ignored.

If escalation is not visibly reflected in:
- Contract tone
- Dialogue tension
- Risk tags
- Rival behavior

Players may perceive punishment as arbitrary.

### Recommendation:
- Escalation must be emotionally legible, not numerically visible.
- Contracts should visibly feel more desperate or volatile over time.

---

# 5️⃣ Economy Pressure Curve

### Observation:
Economy is healthy overall.
Projected deficit encourages meaningful decisions.

### Blind Spot:
Early-game gold totals may feel slightly comfortable unless sinks apply pressure.

### Recommendation:
- Slightly increase early healing or upgrade pressure.
- Ensure Act 1 choices carry opportunity cost.

---

# 6️⃣ Final Boss Variant System

### Strength:
Final boss phases dynamically react to:
- Loyalty Index
- Cohesion Index
- Debt Burden
- Rival Heat
- Faction Alignment

### Blind Spot:
If consequences are not foreshadowed throughout the campaign, players may feel blindsided by endings like:
- Mutiny
- Blood Ledger

### Recommendation:
- Seed terminal “receipts”
- Add subtle narrative warnings
- Foreshadow consequences long before finale

# 7️⃣ Cross-System Integration Opportunities

| System | Current Links | Potential Deepening |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| Combat | Gear, Factions | Relationship tension affecting mid-fight behavior |
| Rival | Contracts | Combat modifiers tied to personal grudges |
| Hooks | Board | Economy penalties or cost modifiers |
| Boss Traits | Shop | Stronger counter-item weighting |

Greater cross-system interaction will elevate the design from layered to fully interwoven.

# 🔥 Top 5 Watchpoints (Priority Monitoring)

1. Mana generation enabling early Ability 2 usage  
2. AEGIS armor scaling dominance  
3. Poison exponential late-game control  
4. Accessory slot systemic overload  
5. Final boss feeling unfair without narrative foreshadowing  

---

# Conclusion

The foundation is strong, modular, and unusually deep.

The current blind spots are not structural failures — they are scaling risks.  
Addressing them early will prevent late-stage rebalance pain.

This system is capable of supporting high mastery and long-term depth.  
Now the focus shifts to stress-testing and cross-system refinement.
