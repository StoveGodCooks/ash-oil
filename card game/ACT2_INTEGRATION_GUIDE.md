# ACT 2: INTEGRATION GUIDE (Side Quests + Rivals + Narrative)

**How Act 2 side quests, rivals, investigation system, and M16 irreversible moment work together**

---

## CORE NARRATIVE SPINE

### Act 2 Progression Arc

**M11–M15: Setup & Recruitment** (Factions court Cassian)
- Cassian arrives in Ridge City, still hunted but not yet exposed
- Three factions (AXIOM, VEIL, DAWN) approach him independently
- Each offers protection, resources, legitimacy
- Cassian seems to have options—the world feels open
- **Investigation Level:** ~30–50% (factions know *something* exists, not what)

**S21–S29: Faction Alignment & Interference** (Side quests create commitment)
- Cassian takes jobs from factions, shifts allegiances based on choices
- Rivals appear gradually: Marius (S21), hints of Cassius (S24), setup for Aelia (S34)
- Investigation intensifies: 50–75% confidence as clues accumulate
- Cassian realizes his choices are creating obligations (can't stay neutral)
- **Investigation Level:** ~50–75% (factions narrowing down *what* Cassian carries)

**S30–S35: Convergence & Exposure Risk** (Rivals activate, investigation accelerates)
- Cassius confronts directly (S30)—State is hunting now
- Ledger fragment surfaces (S31)—biggest moment, determines leak speed
- Aelia appears (S34)—Governor's direct interest revealed
- **Investigation Level:** ~80–90% (near-certainty that Cassian holds ledger)

**M16–M18: The Irreversible Moment** (Ledger becomes known, all factions move)
- M16 "The Leak": Word spreads that Cassian holds ledger
- M17–M18: All factions pivot toward acquisition/destruction/leverage
- Cassian forced to choose faction or be torn apart by all three
- By M18 end: Cassian's position fundamentally changed, neutrality impossible
- **Investigation Level:** 100% (all factions know, all hunt)

---

## SIDE QUEST MECHANICS & INVESTIGATION

### How Investigation Confidence Works

**Investigation Confidence** represents how close factions are to knowing:
1. That the ledger exists
2. That Cassian holds it
3. Where it is and what's in it

Confidence starts at 0% at Act 2 beginning. Grows through:
- Mission activities (natural intel accumulation)
- Side quest choices (Cassian's actions reveal info)
- Rival encounters (direct evidence)
- Cassian's mistakes (failed stealth checks, running, searching)

**At 90%+ confidence:** M16 "The Leak" triggers regardless of player action

### Side Quest Investigation Triggers

| Side Quest | Investigation Increase | How It Leaks Info |
|---|---|---|
| S21 | +0% | (Marius suspicious, not certain) |
| S22 | +0% | (Merchant investigation, no ledger connection) |
| S23 | +3% | Lucius presence in Ridge City shows ledger matters to multiple people |
| S24 | +0% | (Inspection neutral) |
| S25 | +0% | (Faction negotiation, not ledger-related) |
| S26 | +1% | Quarry death investigation could involve ledger documentation |
| S27 | +0% | (Smuggling route, not ledger-related) |
| S28 | +2% | Cult member arrest suggests Priestess monitoring Cassian |
| S29 | +1% | Market sabotage shows Cassian navigating faction politics (suspicious) |
| S30 | +5% | **Cassius directly asks about leverage—investigation accelerates** |
| S31 | +10% | **Ledger fragment surfaces—all factions learn it exists and circulates** |
| S32 | +2% | Spy in ludus gathering evidence specific to Cassian's background |
| S33 | +0% | (Escape route testing neutral) |
| S34 | +3% | Governor's direct interest shows something valuable about Cassian |
| S35 | Locks at 90% | Final side quest before investigation locks |

**Running Total Mechanics:**
- Player can keep investigation below 85% by choosing certain side quest paths
- S31 is THE critical choice: selling fragment (+10%) vs destroying it (-5%)
- By S35, investigation is locked at 90% regardless
- M16 triggers at mission select if investigation ≥90%

### Investigation Threshold Events

**At 50% Confidence:**
- Marius dialogue changes slightly (more knowing, less testing)
- VEIL presence increases (more agents visible in streets)
- Priestess appears subtly at key locations (watching)

**At 70% Confidence:**
- S30 becomes available (Cassius confrontation)
- Rival intel clues increase in confidence
- NPC dialogue hints at "something big brewing"

**At 85% Confidence:**
- VEIL moves to active hunting
- Cassian realizes factions are converging
- Aelia appears for S34 negotiation

**At 90% Confidence:**
- M16 becomes available (but doesn't trigger automatically until mission select)
- All factions position for confrontation
- Rivals show increased urgency

## RIVAL EMERGENCE PATTERN

### Marius (ECLIPSE) Emergence

**Introduction:** S21 "The Debt Collector"
- First direct encounter with rival
- Player learns ECLIPSE ethics: transactional, efficient, amoral
- Marius evaluates Cassian as asset

**Escalation Points:**
- S26/S29: Direct involvement in factional conflicts
- S30+: Realizes Cassian is navigating multiple factions
- Act 3: Becomes ally/enemy based on M18 choice

**Investigation Clues:**
- 35% (S21): "ECLIPSE enforcer evaluates Cassian"
- 60% (S26/S29): "Marius willing to manipulate—suggests knowledge of leverage"
- 75% (Act 3): "Marius runs ECLIPSE networks—knows ledger origin"

### Cassius (VEIL) Emergence

**Introduction:** S30 "The Informant's Leverage"
- Cassius appears directly, confronts Cassian
- This is turning point—State hunter commits personally to case
- Player forced to defend or flee or compromise

**Before S30:**
- S24 shows VEIL presence (inspection, surveillance)
- Indirect mentions (other VEIL agents reference "the hunter")
- Investigation rises as Cassius collects evidence

**After S30:**
- S32: Cassius plants informant, escalates hunt
- Dialogue becomes personal (Cassius sees Cassian as ideological threat)
- Tone: "I will find you and the system will judge you"

**Investigation Clues:**
- 40% (S24): "State investigation with institutional resources"
- 75% (S30): "VEIL hunter specifically hunting Cassian"
- 80% (S32): "Cassius thorough, methodical, won't give up"

### Aelia (Governor) Emergence

**Introduction:** S34 "The Aelia Appearance"
- Woman claims to work for Governor directly
- Offers off-book deal: work for Governor, undermine VEIL, be paid better
- Player must decide: trust, refuse, or refuse-without-reporting

**Before S34:**
- Aelia mentioned indirectly (Governor's moves, high-level State decisions)
- Absent but omnipresent (her hand in events without direct presence)
- Investigation rises as factions make increasingly sophisticated moves

**After S34:**
- If accepted: Aelia becomes handler, reveals larger political game
- If refused: Aelia becomes hidden antagonist (orchestrating against Cassian)
- If never met: She remains shadow until Act 3 reveal

**Investigation Clues:**
- 55% (S34): "Someone above VEIL operating—probably Governor's agent"
- 75% (Act 3): "Aelia has resources beyond VEIL, direct Governor access"
- 90% (Act 3): "Aelia manipulating events from start—goals obscure"

## SIDE QUEST CONSEQUENCES AT M16

### How Side Quests Shape M16 "The Leak"

**M16 always happens.** But how it happens and what players face depends on Act 2 choices.

#### Scenario A: Cassian Sold Ledger Fragment (S31 choice 1)

**Investigation acceleration:** Locked at 95%+ (maximum exposure)

**M16 outcome:**
- Leak happens in M15 or M16 opening
- Leak is immediate and uncontrollable (fragment in circulation)
- All three factions learn simultaneously
- Combat in M16 is chaos—multiple factions attacking at once
- Enemies include: AXIOM merchants, VEIL soldiers, ECLIPSE mercenaries

**Rival reaction:**
- Marius: "You sold it. Now collect the debt."
- Cassius: "You confirmed it exists. You're finished."
- Aelia (if met): "Bold move. Stupid, but bold."

#### Scenario B: Cassian Refused Fragment (S31 choice 2 or 3)

**Investigation locked:** 85–90% (controlled exposure)

**M16 outcome:**
- Leak happens in M16 as planned
- Leak is slower, more contained (mystery source)
- Factions have time to respond strategically
- Combat in M16 is disciplined—one faction primarily hunting, others positioning
- Enemies are faction-specific (not chaotic mix)

**Rival reaction:**
- Marius: "Fragment leak bothers me. Who talked?"
- Cassius: "Leak confirmed. Now hunt begins officially."
- Aelia (if met): "You destroyed it? Interesting. Someone else revealed it, then."

#### Scenario C: Cassian Destroyed Fragment (S31 choice 3)

**Investigation locked:** 80–85% (contained but known)

**M16 outcome:**
- Leak happens in M16 proper
- Leak is mysterious (no fragment means they're inferring)
- Factions move cautiously (uncertain what they're hunting)
- Combat in M16 is interrogative—factions capture rather than kill
- Enemies: Fewer but tougher (specialists, not standard soldiers)

**Rival reaction:**
- Marius: "Destroyed it? You're more ruthless than I thought."
- Cassius: "Source unknown. Cassian is still primary suspect."
- Aelia (if met): "Destroying evidence. Shows you understand the game."

## SIDE QUEST CONSEQUENCES FOR M18

### How Faction Alignment Affects M18 Choice

M18 forces Cassian to choose a faction (or face all three as enemies).

**AXIOM Path** (S22, S29 favor + no VEIL/DAWN dominance)
- Reward: Resources, legitimacy, merchant protection
- Cost: You're now commodity (merchant-aligned, not revolutionary)
- M18 choice: "You're management now. Manage."
- Act 3 consequence: Hunted by VEIL and DAWN, protected by AXIOM

**VEIL Path** (S24, S26, S32, S34 favor + no ECLIPSE/DAWN dominance)
- Reward: Institutional protection, intelligence networks, legitimacy
- Cost: You're now State asset (monitored, constrained, complicit)
- M18 choice: "You serve the system now. Serve it well."
- Act 3 consequence: Hunted by DAWN and ECLIPSE, protected by VEIL

**ECLIPSE Path** (S21, S26 favor + no AXIOM/VEIL dominance)
- Reward: Criminal protection, profit, no moral constraints
- Cost: You're now criminal (hunted by State, exploited by ECLIPSE)
- M18 choice: "You're one of us now. Profitable?"
- Act 3 consequence: Hunted by VEIL, tolerated by AXIOM, allied with ECLIPSE

**DAWN Path** (S25, S28, S33 favor + no AXIOM/VEIL dominance)
- Reward: Revolutionary legitimacy, ideological alignment, purpose
- Cost: You're now rebel (hunted by State, underresourced, ideologically bound)
- M18 choice: "You're with us. Fight with us."
- Act 3 consequence: Hunted by VEIL, tolerated by AXIOM/ECLIPSE, revolutionary

**Multi-Alignment Path** (No clear winner)
- Reward: None (you're isolated)
- Cost: All factions see you as untrustworthy
- M18 choice: Forced to pick one or stand alone (solo path, much harder)
- Act 3 consequence: Hunted by everyone, protected by no one

## RIVAL RELATIONSHIP MATRIX AT M18

### How Side Quest Choices Shift Rival Relationships

| Rival | AXIOM Path | VEIL Path | ECLIPSE Path | DAWN Path | Solo Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Marius** | +1 (neutral) | -2 (enemy) | +3 (ally) | -2 (enemy) | -1 (suspicious) |
| **Cassius** | +1 (neutral) | +2 (ally) | -3 (enemy) | -2 (enemy) | -2 (enemy) |
| **Aelia** | +1 (if S34 neutral) | +2 (if S34 done) | -2 (if refused) | -1 (if refused) | -1 (if refused) |

**Outcome:**
- AXIOM/VEIL/ECLIPSE paths: One rival becomes ally, one becomes enemy, one uncertain
- DAWN path: Cassius becomes enemy, Marius wary, Aelia opposed if met
- Solo path: All rivals view Cassian as threat or potential asset to exploit

---

## M16–M18 COMBAT FLOW

### M16 "The Leak" Combat Design

**Enemies:**
- Faction primary to chosen faction alignment path
- Rival or rival's agents as secondary threat
- Environmental/faction-specific hazards (quarry collapse, State torture equipment, ECLIPSE traps)

**Special Mechanics:**
- Investigation clues continue to reveal during combat (NPC dialogue)
- Faction reinforcements arrive if fight lasts too long (escalating difficulty)
- Escape/retreat options specific to chosen faction (ECLIPSE: smuggling route; VEIL: surrender+interrogation; AXIOM: bribe; DAWN: safe house)

**Victory State:**
- Cassian survives M16 exposure
- One faction clearly knows he holds ledger
- Other factions suspect or know

### M17–M18 Faction Pivot

**M17 "The Shadow War":**
- Two factions begin open conflict over Cassian/ledger
- Cassian can: side with one, play them against each other, or try to escape
- Outcomes determine M18 choice availability

**M18 "Debt Collectors":**
- Final debt clearing, but now complicated by faction warfare
- Cassian must choose which faction to commit to or face all three
- This choice is irreversible—shapes Act 3 entirely

---

## NARRATIVE CONSEQUENCES BY FACTION

### AXIOM Aligned (M18)

**Act 3 Position:**
- Merchant protection, resources, intelligence
- But: Hunted by VEIL (State vs. merchants conflict), hunted by DAWN (anti-capitalist), tolerated by ECLIPSE (profits in trade)
- Rivals: Marius neutral/ally, Cassius hostile, Aelia complex (Governor might want merchants)

**Key Arc:**
- Merchants get weaker as conflict escalates
- Cassian might need to protect Nereus or merchant network from State crackdown
- Or: Merchants betray Cassian if State pressure becomes too high

### VEIL Aligned (M18)

**Act 3 Position:**
- State protection, institutional legitimacy, but constrained
- But: Hunted by ECLIPSE (criminals) and DAWN (revolutionaries), tolerated by AXIOM (merchants cooperate with State)
- Rivals: Cassius becomes handler, Marius hostile, Aelia orchestrating above

**Key Arc:**
- State apparatus becomes Cassian's prison (protection + constraint)
- Cassius might crack ideologically (daughter subplot)
- Cassian becomes tool in larger State power struggle (Cassius vs. Aelia for control)

### ECLIPSE Aligned (M18)

**Act 3 Position:**
- Criminal protection, profit, no moral constraints
- But: Hunted by VEIL (State enforcement), tolerated by AXIOM (merchant crimes), opposed by DAWN (anti-profit)
- Rivals: Marius becomes boss/ally, Cassius becomes mortal enemy, Aelia might recruit

**Key Arc:**
- ECLIPSE becomes increasingly powerful as formal institutions crumble
- Marius's ambitions might grow beyond just protecting Cassian
- Cassian might need to usurp Marius for ECLIPSE leadership (or die trying)

### DAWN Aligned (M18)

**Act 3 Position:**
- Revolutionary legitimacy, purpose, ideological alignment
- But: Hunted by VEIL (State apparatus), tolerated or opposed by AXIOM/ECLIPSE (profit-driven)
- Rivals: Cassius becomes mortal enemy, Marius opportunistic enemy, Aelia orchestrates against

**Key Arc:**
- DAWN is undermanned but ideologically united
- Cassian becomes key strategic asset (ledger as revolutionary weapon)
- Ending determines if revolution succeeds or fails (Cassian's ledger evidence can break State or fail)

### SOLO Aligned (M18)

**Act 3 Position:**
- Hunted by everyone, protected by no one
- Only escape is actual escape (using S27 smuggling route to flee completely)
- Or: Disappear into underground (criminal haven ECLIPSE offers without explicit alliance)
- Rivals: All view Cassian as prey or tool

**Key Arc:**
- Cassian becomes legend (alone against all)
- Act 3 is survival, not victory
- Ending is bittersweet (escape but lose everything, or fall heroically)

## SUMMARY: SIDE QUEST INTEGRATION

**Side quests (S21–S35) are NOT filler.** Each serves specific purpose:

1. **Investigation acceleration** (S30, S31): Moves investigation clock forward
2. **Rival introduction** (S21, S30, S34): Brings rivals into Cassian's orbit
3. **Faction alignment** (S22, S25, S26, S28, S29): Creates webs of obligation
4. **Escape routing** (S27): Enables Act 3 solo path
5. **M16 trigger shaping** (S31): Determines leak speed and faction response
6. **M18 choice gating** (faction alignment): Determines which factions are available as M18 choices

**The ledger investigation and rival system are intertwined.** Rivals appear because they know about ledger. Investigation rises because rivals' interests intersect around ledger. M16 happens because investigation reaches critical mass. M18 choice becomes unavoidable because Cassian is now wanted by all factions.

**Side quests make the world feel alive** — not just narrative, but systemic consequences for player choices. A choice in S26 (quarry investigation) creates ripples that affect Cassius's behavior in S30, which affects M18 availability, which affects Act 3 path.
