# ChatGPT Story Brief - Card Game Mission Design
> **Date:** 2026-02-15
> **Purpose:** Brief for ChatGPT to write story/mission content
> **Your Role:** Design 45 missions (30 MAIN + 15 SIDE) across 2 seasons

---

## 🎯 YOUR TASK

You are designing missions for a **single-player tactical card game** set in a fictional Roman provincial region. Your job is to create **story-driven missions** that integrate with existing game systems.

**You will deliver:**
1. **30 MAIN missions** (M01-M30) - Required story path (15 per season)
2. **30 SIDE missions** (S01-S30) - Optional content (15 per season: companion/rival/faction/chill missions)
3. **Seasonal escalation plan** - How tension builds across 2 seasons

**Total: 60 missions (30 MAIN + 30 SIDE)**

---

## 🎮 GAME STRUCTURE (What You're Writing For)

### **Core Identity:**
- **Genre:** Single-player tactical card game with narrative progression
- **Setting:** Fictional Roman provincial region, early Empire (110-135 CE vibe)
- **Protagonist:** Player is a **slave-turned-gladiator** (always the same character)
- **Tone:** Dark adventure (not grimdark, not heroic - grounded survival)

### **Combat Structure:**
**1 Champion + 2 Lieutenants (Squad Combat):**
- **Champion** = The player (protagonist gladiator)
- **2 Lieutenants** = Recruited companions who fight alongside you
- All 3 units share a deck (player controls everything)
- Lieutenants provide passive bonuses (traits, not separate turns)
- **Individual HP tracking** (each unit can be knocked out separately)

**Example Squad:**
```
Your Squad:
├─ Champion (You): 30 HP, AEGIS faction
├─ Marcus (Lieutenant): 25 HP, "Disciplined" trait (+1 starting hand)
└─ Livia (Lieutenant): 20 HP, "Blessed" trait (+2 Mana start)
```

**Combat is 6 waves per mission:**
- Waves 1-5: Enemy squads (1-3 enemies, escalates)
- Wave 6: Boss encounter (if applicable)
- Between waves: Rest, heal, or retreat

**After missions: Hub**
- Heal injuries (Doctor, Shaman)
- Buy gear/cards (Market, Card Vendor)
- Deck building
- Story events trigger (your job to define)

---

## 📊 CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

### **2 Seasons × 30 Missions Each = 60 Total Missions**

Each season contains:
- **15 MAIN missions** (required story path)
- **15 SIDE missions** (optional content)

---

### **SEASON 1 (Missions M01-M15 + S01-S15)**

**MAIN Missions (M01-M15):**
- Act 1 (M01-M05): **Arena City** - Slave life, arena politics, first companions
- Act 2 (M06-M10): **Ridge City** - Volcano dread, cult vs state conflict
- Act 3 (M11-M15): **Port/Shrine City** - Escalation, Season 1 finale, "Marked" state

**SIDE Missions (S01-S15):**
- 5 Companion missions (S01-S05)
- 5 Rival missions (S06-S10)
- 3 Faction missions (S11-S13)
- 2 Chill/Grind missions (S14-S15)

---

### **SEASON 2 (Missions M16-M30 + S16-S30)**

**MAIN Missions (M16-M30):**
- Act 4 (M16-M20): **Return/Escalation** - Hunted status, faction war
- Act 5 (M21-M25): **Peak Conflict** - Lock in faction alignment
- Act 6 (M26-M30): **Endings** - 3 ending paths (Cult/State/Solo)

**SIDE Missions (S16-S30):**
- 5 Companion missions (S16-S20, continued arcs for core lieutenants)
- 5 Rival missions (S21-S25, escalation beats)
- 3 Faction missions (S26-S28, deepening alignment)
- 2 Chill/Grind missions (S29-S30, repeatable)

---

**Structure Per Act:**
- Each Act = 5 MAIN missions
- Mission 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 = **Boss missions** (major story beats)
- Mission 30 = **Final boss** (ending depends on faction alignment)

**SIDE Mission Categories (Per Season):**

**1. Companion Missions (5 per season, 10 total):**
- Each of 5 core lieutenants gets companion arcs across both seasons
- Season 1: S01-S05 (one per lieutenant, recruitment/introduction)
- Season 2: S16-S20 (one per lieutenant, continuation/resolution)
- Advance their personal story (hook resolution)
- Rewards: Loyalty boost, signature cards, unique gear

**2. Rival Missions (5 per season, 10 total):**
- 5 rival characters (Rival Gladiator, Cult Hunter, Governor's Enforcer, Syndicate Boss, Lanista)
- Season 1: S06-S10 (introduction/first confrontation)
- Season 2: S21-S25 (escalation/resolution)
- Unlocked by story triggers (high RENOWN, HEAT, etc.)
- Rewards: Neutralize threat, rare gear, meter changes

**3. Faction Missions (3 per season, 6 total):**
- 3 factions (Cult, Governor/State, Arena Mob)
- Season 1: S11-S13 (one per faction, introduction)
- Season 2: S26-S28 (one per faction, deepening alignment)
- Deepen faction alignment (boost PIETY or FAVOR)
- Optional but affects ending routes
- Rewards: Faction-specific cards/gear, meter boosts

**4. Chill/Grind Missions (2 per season, 4 total):**
- Repeatable "brainless battles" for resources
- Season 1: S14-S15 (Training Grounds, Beast Hunt)
- Season 2: S29-S30 (Advanced versions or new grind spots)
- No story, just combat practice
- Rewards: Gold, XP, stress relief for players

**Total SIDE: 30 missions (10 companion + 10 rival + 6 faction + 4 chill)**

---

## 🔗 STORY-TO-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION (Critical!)

### **Every MAIN Mission Must Produce 2-3 of These Outputs:**

**1. Hook Created/Advanced/Resolved:**
- **Hooks** = story complications that create events
- Examples: "Marcus is hunted by former commander", "Cult demands blood sacrifice", "Lanista threatens to sell you"
- Hooks trigger events at hub (you must design these)

**2. Meter Changes:**
Six tracked meters (0-10 or 0-20 scales):
- **RENOWN** (fame/visibility): 0-20 scale
- **HEAT** (government scrutiny): 0-15 scale
- **PIETY** (cult standing): 0-10 scale
- **FAVOR** (political backing): 0-10 scale
- **DEBT** (owed gold): 0-500+ gold
- **DREAD** (volcano fear, Ridge City only): 0-10 scale

**3. Service State Changes:**
- Services: Doctor, Shaman, Market, Card Vendor, Black Market
- States: Normal / Expensive (+50% price) / Restricted (1x per mission) / Closed (unavailable)
- Example: "Betray Cult → Shaman service closes"

**4. Route State Changes:**
- 3 routes: Arena↔Ridge, Ridge↔Port, Port↔Shrine
- States: Safe / Watched (+20g toll) / Dangerous (+30% ambush) / Closed (alternate route required)
- Example: "High HEAT → all routes become Dangerous"

**5. Relationship Changes:**
- Lieutenant loyalty (0-10 per lieutenant)
- Rival escalation (rivalHeat increases)
- Faction alignment (PIETY vs FAVOR conflict)

## 🌋 SEASONAL ESCALATION (How Tension Builds)

### **DREAD Meter (Volcano, Ridge City Only):**

**Season 1 (M01-M15):**
- M01-M05 (Arena City): DREAD = 0 (volcano not introduced yet)
- M06-M10 (Ridge City): DREAD 0 → 3 (Tier 1: Rumors → Tier 2: Minor anomalies)
- M11-M15 (Port/Shrine): DREAD = 3 (stable, ominous background)

**Season 2 (M16-M30):**
- M16-M20: DREAD 3 → 6 (Tier 2: Anomalies → Tier 3: Panic)
- M21-M25: DREAD 6 → 8 (Tier 3: Panic, services close)
- M26-M30: DREAD 8-10 (Tier 4: Cordon, routes restricted, permits required)

**DREAD Effects:**
- Tier 1 (0-2): Normal (just rumors)
- Tier 2 (3-5): Minor anomalies (+10% service costs in Ridge City)
- Tier 3 (6-8): Panic (some Ridge City services close, evacuations)
- Tier 4 (9-10): Cordon (Ridge City routes restricted, permits required)

**Your Job:** Decide which Ridge City missions increase DREAD (+1 or +2 per mission).

---

### **HEAT vs PIETY Conflict (Cult vs State):**

**Season 1:**
- M01-M05: Neutral possible (can avoid both factions)
- M06-M10: Cult introduced, choice available (join or ignore)
- M11-M15: Conflict escalates (choosing one angers the other)

**Season 2:**
- M16-M20: Neutrality becomes impossible (forced interactions)
- M21-M25: Faction lock-in (must choose Cult OR State)
- M26-M30: Ending route determined (Cult Victory / State Victory / Solo Escape)

**Conflict Rules:**
- **High PIETY (cult) + High FAVOR (state) = IMPOSSIBLE**
- At PIETY ≥6 OR FAVOR ≥6, the other faction becomes hostile
- Example: PIETY 7 → Governor (HEAT) increases automatically
- Example: FAVOR 7 → Cult (PIETY) becomes hunted status

**Your Job:** Design missions that force PIETY vs FAVOR choices (can't satisfy both).

---

### **RENOWN Escalation (Fame = Danger):**

**Season 1:**
- M01-M05: RENOWN 0-5 (unknown, low-paying contracts)
- M06-M10: RENOWN 6-10 (known, rival gladiator appears)
- M11-M15: RENOWN 11-15 (famous, assassination attempts, high-stakes games)

**Season 2:**
- M16-M20: RENOWN 16-18 (legendary, can't hide)
- M21-M25: RENOWN 19-20 (maximum fame, political tool)

**RENOWN Effects:**
- 0-5: Unknown (basic contracts only)
- 6-10: Known (rival appears, better contracts)
- 11-15: Famous (rivals escalate, assassination attempts)
- 16-20: Legendary (can't hide, political weapon)

**Your Job:** Boss missions (M05, M10, M15, etc.) always increase RENOWN (+2-3).

## 📝 HISTORICAL TEXTURE TO USE

**From Canon Bible (Use These for Flavor):**

**Arena City:**
- Game-fixing, betting dens, deposit/fines for dead gladiators
- Freedmen with ties to decurions (corruption)
- Seating hierarchy as social map (shame tactics)

**Ridge City:**
- Sulfur smell, heated baths fed by volcanic vents
- Quarry lung-cough, bodies "lost" into vents
- Temple to Vulcan outside city, proxy burials
- Taboo zones (burial sites, feared)

**Port City:**
- Horrea warehouses, annona grain oversight
- Navicularii shipping guild, customs fraud
- Beast mortality fraud (claim beast died, sell alive)
- Syndicate smuggling

**Shrine Town:**
- Imperial cult processions, flamines, Seviri Augustales
- Competing mystery cults (Isis/Mithras-like)
- Omen manufacturing (fake prodigies for politics)
- Impiety accusations ruin rivals

**Travel (Between Cities):**
- Mansiones/mutationes (rest stops)
- Beneficiarii checkpoints, toll gates (portoria)
- Bandit networks (latrones)
- Extortion by officials

**Religion:**
- Pax deorum logic (gods favor = civic stability)
- Prodigies trigger expiation rites
- Lectisternium (feast for gods as crowd control)
- Defixiones (curse tablets)

## ✅ QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before delivering, verify each MAIN mission has:
- [ ] Clear story beat (what happens?)
- [ ] 2-3 system outputs (hooks, meters, services, routes, relationships)
- [ ] Win AND retreat outcomes (fail-forward design)
- [ ] Historical texture (at least 1 Roman detail)
- [ ] Lieutenant integration (recruit, loyalty, or hook advancement)

Before delivering, verify SIDE missions have:
- [ ] Clear category (Companion/Rival/Faction/Chill)
- [ ] Unlock trigger (after which MAIN mission?)
- [ ] Player choice with consequences
- [ ] Mechanical rewards (loyalty, gear, meter boost)

Before delivering, verify escalation has:
- [ ] DREAD progression table (0-10, Ridge City focus)
- [ ] HEAT vs PIETY conflict timeline
- [ ] RENOWN escalation (0-20)
- [ ] Ending lock-in point (M21-25)

---

## 🎯 FINAL NOTES

**Tone Guidance:**
- Dark adventure (not grimdark torture, not heroic triumph)
- Grounded survival (slave navigating corrupt system)
- Player agency matters (choices have weight)
- Fail-forward (losses create consequences, not game-overs)

**Story Philosophy:**
- Every mission must matter mechanically
- Side content is optional but meaningful (not filler)
- Lieutenants are companions, not servants
- Factions use you as tool (not allies, not pure evil)
- Endings reflect player choices (not random)

**Writing Style:**
- Modular (missions can be played out of order for side content)
- Concise (2-3 sentence story beats, not prose scenes)
- Mechanically clear (state meter changes, service triggers explicitly)

---

**YOU NOW HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO WRITE THE CAMPAIGN.**

**Start with Season 1 (M01-M15) + 15 SIDE missions.**
**Once approved, write Season 2 (M16-M30).**

Good luck! 🎯
