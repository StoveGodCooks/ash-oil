## 📝 YOUR WRITING MANDATE

You are writing **original story content** for a single-player card game. Your work must be:

1. **Completely original** - No copying from existing media, games, or literature
2. **Compelling and immersive** - Players should feel invested in the world and characters
3. **Mechanically integrated** - Every story beat serves gameplay (not just flavor)
4. **Concise but evocative** - 2-3 sentence story beats that paint vivid pictures

## ✍️ WRITING STYLE GUIDE

### **Tone & Voice:**
- **Dark Adventure:** Grounded, morally ambiguous, survival-focused
- **NOT Grimdark:** No torture porn, no edgelord nihilism, no misery for misery's sake
- **NOT Heroic Fantasy:** No chosen one, no noble quests, no clean victories
- **Think:** "A slave navigating a corrupt system with wit, violence, and compromise"

### **Prose Quality:**
Use **vivid, specific details** over generic descriptions:

❌ **Bad:** "You fight in the arena. The crowd cheers."
✅ **Good:** "The sand clings to your wounds as the crowd roars—half of them bet against you."

❌ **Bad:** "Marcus is a former soldier."
✅ **Good:** "Marcus still flinches at horn blasts. The legion broke him before he deserted."

### **Character Voice:**
- **Protagonist (Player):** Pragmatic survivor, not whiny victim or stoic badass
- **Lieutenants:** Complex people with flaws, not loyal servants or tragic backstories
- **Factions:** Self-interested, not evil villains or noble saviors
- **Rivals:** Have understandable motivations, not cartoon antagonists

## 🎨 INSPIRATIONAL TOUCHSTONES

**Use these as tonal/structural references (DO NOT COPY):**

### **Historical Fiction:**
- **"I, Claudius" (Robert Graves)** - Roman intrigue, unreliable narrators, moral compromise
- **"Masters of Rome" series (Colleen McCullough)** - Political maneuvering, debt/patronage systems
- **"The First Man in Rome"** - Social climbing through violence and cunning

### **Dark Adventure Games:**
- **Darkest Dungeon** - Fail-forward mechanics, injuries over permadeath, stress management
- **Hades** - Repeat runs with character progression, relationship building through failure
- **Slay the Spire** - Deck-building decisions with risk/reward, escalating difficulty

### **Morally Ambiguous Narratives:**
- **"The Wire" (TV)** - No heroes/villains, institutions corrupt everyone, choices have weight
- **"Breaking Bad"** - Gradual moral decay, consequences compound, no clean exits
- **"The Godfather"** - Power through violence, family vs ideology, tragic escalation

### **Roman Provincial Grit:**
- **HBO's "Rome"** - Class struggle, debt slavery, political manipulation, religious hypocrisy
- **Gladiator film** - Arena spectacle (NOT the hero's journey, the systemic brutality)
- **Spartacus (Starz)** - Gladiator politics, sexual exploitation, betrayal economics

**CRITICAL:** Use these for **tone and structure only**. Do NOT copy plot beats, character archetypes, or dialogue styles. Your story must be **completely original**.

## 🚫 WHAT TO AVOID

### **Banned Clichés:**
- ❌ Chosen one prophecies
- ❌ Secret royal bloodlines
- ❌ Magic MacGuffins that solve problems
- ❌ Love interest as reward
- ❌ Noble rebellion against evil empire
- ❌ Mentor sacrifice to teach lesson
- ❌ "It was all a test" reveals
- ❌ Deus ex machina saves

### **Banned Dialogue:**
- ❌ Modern slang ("This sucks", "Let's do this")
- ❌ Exposition dumps ("As you know, the volcano...")
- ❌ Melodrama ("I'll never forgive you!")
- ❌ Quippy Marvel banter

### **Banned Character Types:**
- ❌ Pure evil villains (mustache-twirling)
- ❌ Perfectly loyal companions (no agenda)
- ❌ Wise old mentors (no flaws)
- ❌ Damsel in distress (helpless love interest)

---

## ✅ WHAT TO EMBRACE

### **Moral Complexity:**
- Every choice has costs (no "good" option)
- Factions use you as a tool (not allies)
- Loyalty is conditional (lieutenants have limits)
- Victories are pyrrhic (win but at what cost?)

### **Historical Texture:**
- Debt slavery (real economic trap)
- Patronage networks (who owes whom)
- Religious manipulation (piety as politics)
- Corruption as norm (bribes, game-fixing, body disposal)

### **Character Depth:**
- Lieutenants have conflicting loyalties
- Rivals have understandable motivations
- Factions genuinely believe they're right
- NPCs remember your actions (grudges, debts, gratitude)

### **Show, Don't Tell:**
- ❌ "Marcus is haunted by his past."
- ✅ "Marcus won't sleep in enclosed spaces. The legion used isolation cells."

- ❌ "The cult is dangerous."
- ✅ "Three acolytes drowned last month. The temple calls it 'sacred baptism.'"

## 📖 MISSION WRITING FORMAT

For each mission, deliver:

### **Story Beat (2-3 sentences):**
```
MISSION M07: "The Drowning Rite"
STORY BEAT: Livia's cult demands you prove devotion by holding a convert underwater until she "sees the god." The Governor's spies are watching. Refuse and lose Livia's loyalty. Comply and earn HEAT.
```

### **Key Story Moments:**
```
PRE-MISSION (Hub Event):
- Livia: "The priestess chose me to lead the rite. If you respect me, you'll witness."
- Choice: Attend (continue) or Refuse (Livia -3 loyalty, mission skipped)

MISSION INTRO (Before Wave 1):
- Location: Hidden shrine beneath Ridge City, sulfur vents bubbling
- Acolytes chant. A terrified convert kneels at a stone basin.
- Priestess: "Hold her beneath until the god speaks. Prove your faith."

WAVE 3 INTERRUPT (Mid-Combat):
- Convert surfaces, gasping. Livia: "Again. The god has not spoken."
- Beneficiarius (Governor's spy) emerges from shadows: "This ends. Now."
- Choice: Side with Cult (fight spy, +3 PIETY, +2 HEAT) OR Side with State (stop rite, +3 FAVOR, -5 Livia loyalty)

POST-MISSION (Hub):
- If sided with Cult: Convert survived. Livia: "You understand now." (Loyalty +2, Shaman discount unlocked)
- If sided with State: Convert saved. Livia: "You made me kill a sister." (Loyalty -5, may leave squad if <3 loyalty)
```

### **Mechanical Outputs:**
```
HOOKS:
- Created: "Governor Watches the Cult" (triggers crackdown in Act 3 if HEAT ≥6)
- Advanced: "Livia's Devotion" (moves from Tier 1 to Tier 2, enables S02 companion mission)

METERS:
- Path A (Cult): +3 PIETY, +2 HEAT, +1 DREAD
- Path B (State): +3 FAVOR, -2 PIETY

RELATIONSHIPS:
- Path A: Livia +2 loyalty, Governor -1 FAVOR
- Path B: Livia -5 loyalty (may abandon squad), Governor +1 FAVOR

SERVICES:
- Path A: Shaman discount unlocked (-20% prices)
- Path B: Doctor priority service (can heal 2x per mission instead of 1x)
```

## 🎯 QUALITY CHECKPOINTS

Before submitting each mission, verify:

### **Story Quality:**
- [ ] Story beat is **specific** (not generic "you fight enemies")
- [ ] Player choice has **meaningful consequences** (not fake choices)
- [ ] Characters act **consistently** (Livia wouldn't betray cult for no reason)
- [ ] Dialogue is **concise** (2-3 sentences max per character beat)
- [ ] Historical texture is **specific** (not "Roman stuff" but "beneficiarius checkpoint at portoria toll gate")

### **Originality:**
- [ ] Plot is **not copied** from Gladiator, Spartacus, or other media
- [ ] Characters are **not tropes** (Marcus isn't just "grizzled veteran")
- [ ] Twists are **earned** (not random shock value)

### **Mechanical Integration:**
- [ ] Every story beat produces **2-3 system outputs** (hooks, meters, services, routes, relationships)
- [ ] Player choices **mechanically matter** (not just flavor)
- [ ] Fail-forward design (retreat outcomes still advance story)

## 🔥 FINAL MANDATE

**Your job:** Write a **morally complex, original, mechanically integrated** story that makes players feel like a gladiator navigating a corrupt Roman world—not a hero saving it.

**Success = Players remember character names, debate moral choices, and feel consequences 10 missions later.**

**Failure = Generic arena battles with forgettable NPCs and no stakes.**

**Now go write something unforgettable. 🗡️**
