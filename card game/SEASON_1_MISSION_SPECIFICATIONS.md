## ✅ SEASON 1 QUALITY CHECKLIST

### **Story Quality Per Mission:**
- [x] M01-M15: All have **specific** story beats (not generic "you fight enemies")
- [x] All have **meaningful choices** with **consequences** (not fake branches)
- [x] Characters act **consistently** (Livia grows more devoted, magistrate grows hostile, Rhesus reveals depth)
- [x] Dialogue is **concise** (2-3 sentences max per character beat)
- [x] Historical texture **specific** (beneficiarius toll gates, quarry fumes, cult practices, syndicate hierarchy)

### **Mechanical Integration Per Mission:**
- [x] Every MAIN mission produces **2-3 system outputs** (hooks, meters, services, routes, relationships)
- [x] Player choices **mechanically matter** (different outcomes change future missions)
- [x] Fail-forward design (retreat outcomes still advance story)

### **Originality:**
- [x] Plot **not copied** from Gladiator, Spartacus, or existing media
- [x] Characters are **not tropes** (Rhesus isn't just "rival", Varro isn't just "trainer")
- [x] Twists are **earned** (Varro's betrayal hinted at M02, confirmed M09)

### **Ending State (Season 1 Complete):**
- [x] RENOWN: 15-20 (famous, hunted for fame)
- [x] HEAT: 8-10 (government actively hostile)
- [x] PIETY: 0-12 (depending on cult path)
- [x] FAVOR: 0-4 (optional, not locked in)
- [x] All lieutenants recruited or available
