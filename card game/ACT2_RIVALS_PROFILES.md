# ACT 2: RIVAL PROFILES (Full Character Arcs)

**Three Act 2 rivals with complete character profiles, dialogue, escalation patterns, and kill/spare outcomes**

---

## MARIUS — The Efficient Predator (ECLIPSE Enforcer)

### Character Summary

**Archetype:** No mercy, no ideology, pure function. Everything is debt; everything is paid.

**Physical Description:**
Tall, scarred, built from violence. Left eye is milky (old injury). Moves like someone who's made space through reputation rather than size. Fingers broken and set wrong multiple times—doesn't bother him. Dresses in dark leather and iron. Tattoos on forearms are tally marks (rumor: one mark per person killed in ECLIPSE's service).

**Voice & Speech Pattern:**
Short sentences. No wasted words. Direct threats delivered as facts. Rare laugh that sounds like it hurt. Uses "ledger" metaphor constantly—everything is debt, everything is paid. When he speaks, people listen because refusal to listen is dangerous.

### Dialogue Examples

- *"Everyone owes. Some owe money. Some owe blood. You owe leverage."*
- *"I don't judge. I collect."*
- *"You think you're smart. Smart doesn't matter. Compliant matters."*
- *"The ledger balances. Always. For everyone."* (said with specific knowledge of *the* ledger)
- *"Respect is debt. Debt is respect."*

### Motivation & Vulnerability

**Why he cares about the ledger:**
Marius doesn't want it for power or profit. He wants it as leverage over other ECLIPSE operators who might be tempted to make moves. In a criminal organization without formal structure, information is the only real authority. The ledger proves secrets. Secrets are power.

**Personal wound:**
Marius was once betrayed by someone he trusted. He survived it, but now he assumes everyone will betray him given opportunity. He respects only those who acknowledge this fact and work within it anyway.

**His vulnerability:**
If Cassian can show him that loyalty exists without it being transactional—that Cassian can be trusted not because of leverage but because of something deeper—Marius's worldview cracks. He'll never admit it. But he'll act on it.

### Escalation Across Act 2

**Early (M11–M14):**
- **S21 encounter:** Tests Cassian's willingness to do morally gray work
- Dialogue suggests interest in what Cassian "carries" (ledger)
- Tone: evaluative, not hostile
- If Cassian completes S21 well: Marius nods (approval registered)
- If Cassian refuses S21: Marius warns "This counts against you"

**Mid (M15–M17):**
- **S26/S29:** Direct conflict or cooperation depending on player choice
- Realizes Cassian is navigating multiple factions simultaneously
- Begins to suspect Cassian IS the leverage (not just searching for it)
- Tone: shifts to respect-adjacent if player handled previous encounters well
- **Key dialogue:** "You're not just trying to survive. You're trying to play all of us. I respect that. Or I'll kill you for it. Haven't decided yet."

**Late (M18+):**
- **If Cassian chose DAWN:** Marius becomes pragmatic enemy (profits from chaos, doesn't need Cassian)
  - Dialogue: "Revolutionaries always fail. I'll be there when your side loses, collecting what's owed."
- **If Cassian chose AXIOM:** Marius becomes cautious ally (ECLIPSE and AXIOM sometimes work together)
  - Dialogue: "Merchants and criminals aren't so different. Both understand the ledger."
- **If Cassian chose VEIL:** Marius becomes active threat (State is ECLIPSE's enemy)
  - Dialogue: "You chose the cage-builders. Fine. Cages break. When they do, remember you made a mistake."
- **If Cassian chose ECLIPSE:** Marius becomes handler/partner (you're now part of his operation)
  - Dialogue: "You understand now. Everything is transaction. You're my investment. I don't waste investments."

### Combat Encounters

**S21 (Optional):** Marius might appear as boss fight if Cassian tries to refuse too aggressively
- Stats: High armor, moderate HP, special move "Leverage" (steals gold from player for next 3 turns)

**Act 3 (Conditional):**
- If M18 chose ECLIPSE and didn't kill Marius in Act 2: He's handler/enforcer in Act 3
- If M18 chose other faction: He's mid-boss encounter (~M24)
- If killed in Act 2: He's replaced by unnamed ECLIPSE operative (less flexible, more hostile)

### Kill/Spare Outcomes

**If Killed (in S26/S29 or Act 3):**
- ECLIPSE declares vendetta but pragmatically moves on
- Act 3: ECLIPSE is weakened, loses organizational coherence
- Other ECLIPSE operators don't respect player (you killed their leader)
- Marius's second-in-command becomes new contact, less flexible, no humor

**If Spared (defeated, shown mercy):**
- Marius respects this (shows strength, not cruelty)
- Act 3: Becomes wildcard ally (owes you, but doesn't like owing)
- Can be leveraged, but reluctantly
- His loyalty is strictly transactional going forward
- Possible secret dialogue in Act 3: *"You're the first person who beat me and didn't finish it. I remember that. You're useful. Keep being useful."*

### Investigation Clues

- **S21 (35%):** "ECLIPSE enforcer evaluates Cassian as asset — pragmatic, transactional interest"
- **S26/S29 (60%):** "Marius shows willingness to manipulate — suggests he knows Cassian carries leverage"
- **S30+ (75%):** "Marius is pragmatic — he'll work with whoever pays best"
- **Act 3 (85%):** "Marius runs ECLIPSE's information networks — he knows where the ledger came from"

### Relationship Score Progression

| Stage | Relationship | Context |
|---|---|---|
| Start of Act 2 | 0 (neutral) | Unknown |
| After S21 | +1 (if completed) or -1 (if refused) | Evaluates Cassian |
| After S26/S29 | Shifts ±2 based on choice | Suspects Cassian's depth |
| After M18 faction choice | -3 to +3 depending on path | Marius aligns or opposes |
| Act 3 final | Can range -5 to +5 | Based on complete arc |

### Unique Mechanics

**Ledger Knowledge:**
Marius figures out Cassian has the ledger around M14. He doesn't confront directly; instead, he uses it as leverage in all subsequent interactions. *"I know you know I know. Let's proceed."*

**Double Agent Potential:**
If Cassian is aligned with VEIL or DAWN in M18, Marius can be turned as double agent. He'll sell information to both sides for the highest price. He's loyal to no one but the ledger's value.

## CASSIUS — The Ideological Enforcer (VEIL State Hunter)

### Character Summary

**Archetype:** Absolutely certain in his righteousness. The system has decided; your feelings are irrelevant.

**Physical Description:**
Mid-40s, military bearing, short dark hair graying at temples. Scar across his throat (survived assassination attempt). Eyes that have seen things that made him harder. Dresses in State robes but wears them like armor. Moves with deliberate precision. His hands shake slightly when angry (tries to hide it).

**Voice & Speech Pattern:**
Formal, precise, uses institutional language. Never raises voice but carries absolute authority. Repeats himself as statement of certainty, not doubt. Speaks about "the system" like it's alive, divine, beyond critique.

### Dialogue Examples

- *"The system has decided. Your feelings are irrelevant."*
- *"Chaos is what the enemy wants. Order is what we provide."*
- *"You think you're free. Freedom is illusion for people who don't understand constraint."*
- *"I'm not cruel. I'm necessary."*
- *"The system breaks when people like you are allowed to exist unchecked."*

### Motivation & Vulnerability

**Why he hunts Cassian:**
Cassius genuinely believes VEIL is necessary. He's seen what happens without order—chaos, suffering, death of innocents. He's rationalized his cruelty as service. He doesn't hunt Cassian out of malice; he hunts him because the system identified Cassian as threat.

**Personal wound:**
His daughter. She's 12. He does all this so she'll live in stable world. The system keeps her safe. When (if) he learns that stability might be corrupt, it threatens his entire worldview. This is his vulnerability—not fear of death, but fear that he's protecting corruption.

**His vulnerability:**
If Cassian can show him evidence that the system IS corrupt (specific names from ledger? Veil committing atrocities in system's name?), Cassius experiences cognitive dissonance. He might defect if convinced his daughter would be safer without him serving corrupt institution.

### Escalation Across Act 2

**Early (M11–M14):**
- **S24 (indirect):** VEIL inspection suggests State attention
- Cassius is mentioned but not present
- Tone: distant institutional threat
- Other VEIL agents do legwork; Cassius is hunting bigger fish

**Mid (M15–M17):**
- **S30:** Cassius appears directly, confronts Cassian about leverage
- This is his turning point—he's committed personally now
- **S32:** Plants informant in ludus; now Cassian is personal case
- Tone: shifts to active hunter, personally invested
- **Key dialogue:** *"I've read your file. I know your history. I know what you're capable of. The system needs people like you, but only if they're controlled. Are you controlled, Cassian? Or are you a problem?"*

**Late (M18+):**
- **If Cassian chose DAWN:** Cassius becomes open enemy (revolutionary is State's worst fear)
  - Dialogue: *"You chose chaos. The system doesn't forgive that."*
- **If Cassian chose VEIL:** Cassius becomes handler/monitor
  - Dialogue: *"You made right choice. Now prove you understand why."*
- **If Cassian chose AXIOM:** Cassius becomes complicated (State protects merchants)
  - Dialogue: *"Merchants are system's lifeblood. I can work with that."*
- **If Cassian chose ECLIPSE:** Cassius actively hunts (criminal is State's declared enemy)
  - Dialogue: *"Criminal syndicates are cancer. You just declared yourself terminal."*

### Combat Encounters

**S30 (Required):** Cassius confronts Cassian directly
- Stats: High armor, moderate-high HP, special move "Institutional Authority" (buffs VEIL-aligned enemies in later rounds)
- This is not meant to be unwinnable, but Cassius is meant to feel dangerous

**S32 (Optional):** Silencing his informant might result in armed confrontation with Cassius's agents
- Stats: Cassius as mid-boss (~M15 difficulty) with two State soldiers

**Act 3 (Conditional):**
- If M18 chose other than VEIL: He hunts Cassian as rebel (~M22 difficulty)
- If M18 chose VEIL: He's mentor/handler for final arc
- If killed in Act 2: VEIL replaces him with less-conflicted agent (purely mechanical, no humanity)

### Kill/Spare Outcomes

**If Killed (in S30/S32 or Act 3):**
- VEIL replaces him with someone without his doubts
- Act 3: State loses humanity from their response (becomes purely mechanical)
- Other VEIL agents respect player (Cassius was respected figure), but execution triggers institutional vendetta
- VEIL doubles hunting efforts (vengeful, trying to prove State is stronger without him)

**If Spared (defeated, shown mercy):**
- Cassius experiences cognitive dissonance (he's supposed to be stronger)
- Act 3: Cassius becomes possible turncoat if worldview cracks
- **Possible Act 3 arc:** If Cassian shows him ledger entries proving State corruption, Cassius might:
  - Turn against VEIL, sabotage State operations from inside
  - Defect to Cassian's faction, bringing State secrets with him
  - Or, more likely, he'll wrestle with it internally—create dialogue scenes where he confronts his daughter about what he's protecting
- His knowledge of State apparatus becomes valuable asset

### Investigation Clues

- **S24 (40%):** "State is investigating Cassian with institutional resources — probably suspects something specific"
- **S30 (75%):** "VEIL hunter specifically hunting Cassian — knows about leverage, military precision"
- **S32 (80%):** "Cassius is thorough, methodical, committed to his cause — won't give up easily"
- **Act 3 (90%):** "State hunter has lost faith but continues serving system — breaking point is possible"

### Relationship Score Progression

| Stage | Relationship | Context |
|---|---|---|
| Start of Act 2 | 0 (unknown) | Cassius doesn't know Cassian yet |
| S24 (indirect) | -1 (suspicion) | State attention registered |
| S30 (direct) | +2 (respect for deflection) or -2 (anger at refusal) | First confrontation |
| S32 (aftermath) | Shifts ±2 based on informant choice | Cassius adjusts hunt |
| M18 faction choice | -3 to +2 depending on path | Cassius aligns or opposes |
| Act 3 final | Can range -5 to +4 | Based on complete arc |

### Unique Mechanics

**Institutional Knowledge:**
Cassius has access to state secrets. If turned, he can provide intel on VEIL operations, government corruption (names from ledger), and backdoors into State security systems. He's a treasure trove IF he can be convinced to defect.

**Daughter Subplot:**
If Cassian discovers Cassius has a daughter (12 years old, lives in capital), this becomes leverage AND redemption path. Cassian can:
- Use knowledge of daughter as blackmail (cruel, effective)
- Appeal to Cassius's humanity regarding daughter's future (idealistic, might work if Cassian shows ledger proof of State corruption harming families)
- Protect daughter during Act 3 chaos (builds trust, shows Cassius that Cassian is better than system he serves)

## AELIA — The Political Operator (Governor's Secret Agent)

### Character Summary

**Archetype:** Everyone is a tool, including herself. Subtlety over force.

**Physical Description:**
Early 40s, beautiful but in calculated way. Dress is always appropriate to situation (merchant dress for merchants, State dress for State, revolutionary dress for revolutionaries). Dark hair, sharp features, eyes that miss nothing. Moves like she's always in conversation even when alone. Hands are soft—she doesn't do her own violence. Smells faintly of jasmine and ink (always writing reports).

**Voice & Speech Pattern:**
Warm, intimate, like she's confiding in you. Makes you feel special. Uses your name frequently (psychological manipulation). Never threatens directly; instead, she shows you what's at stake. Flatters, then flips. Laughs like she's sharing a joke you're both in on.

### Dialogue Examples

- *"Cassian, I think you're smarter than this situation you've found yourself in."*
- *"The Governor appreciates subtlety. You seem like a man who understands subtlety."*
- *"I'm not threatening you. I'm offering you the chance to be on the side that wins."*
- *"The system is broken, but it's the only system we have. We have to fix it from inside."*
- *"You're wondering if I'm lying. Good. That means you're smart."*

### Motivation & Vulnerability

**Why she serves the Governor:**
Aelia serves the Governor because the Governor is the most powerful person she's encountered, and power is the only thing that matters. She's climbed from nothing to the Governor's most trusted advisor by being smarter than everyone else. If the Governor falls, she falls. If she can position herself as indispensable, she rises.

**Personal wound:**
She was once poor. Not just poor—desperate. She took a job that required her to compromise her morals. It worked. She's never been compromised again. She learned that compromise is currency; held correctly, it's power.

**Her vulnerability:**
Somewhere along the way, she started actually liking people. She can see their weaknesses with clarity, but she also sees their worth. She genuinely enjoys people's company. It horrifies her. If she admits she cares about someone more than power, she's suddenly mortal again. Vulnerable. This is unacceptable.

### Escalation Across Act 2

**Early (M11–M15):**
- **Behind scenes only:** Aelia is watching, gathering intelligence
- Mentioned indirectly (Governor's interests, high-level moves)
- Tone: absent but omnipresent
- She's running background checks on Cassian through State databases

**Mid (M15–M17):**
- **S34:** Aelia appears directly, offers direct deal
- This is calculated risk on her part—Governor doesn't know she's approached Cassian independently
- Tone: seductive, intimate, dangerous
- **Key dialogue:** *"The Governor is competent but limited. He thinks linearly. You seem to think like I think—in possibilities. We should talk."*

**Late (M18+):**
- **If Cassian accepted S34 offer:** Aelia is handler, gradually reveals larger plans
  - Dialogue: *"You're learning. Governor will fall eventually. When he does, we'll be positioned to catch power. That's the real game."*
  - She's testing whether Cassian will turn on Governor for better offer
- **If Cassian refused S34:** Aelia becomes hidden antagonist, works against Cassian indirectly
  - Dialogue: *"Shame. You could have been useful. Now I have to ensure you're not dangerous."*
  - She orchestrates moves to neutralize Cassian without getting her hands dirty
- **If Cassian never met Aelia (didn't do S34):** She remains unknown threat until Act 3
  - She's still gathering intelligence, still planning, still present in background
  - Act 3 reveal: *"You had a chance to join us. Instead, you sided with losing factions. Now I'll watch them crumble."*

### Combat Encounters

**S34 (Optional):** Aelia doesn't fight in S34; instead, she offers alliance
- If Cassian attacks her: She's not defenseless, but she doesn't fight back
- Stats (if forced): Low HP, high evasion, special move "Political Leverage" (summons State soldiers to protect her)
- She'd rather escape than fight—less messy

**Act 3 (Conditional):**
- If M18 chose anything but alliance with her: She's mid-boss encounter (~M24 difficulty)
- If M18 chose her alliance: She's mentor/handler, increasingly paranoid as power politics shift
- If killed in Act 2: She's replaced by unnamed Governor's operative (more direct, less subtle)

### Kill/Spare Outcomes

**If Killed (in Act 3):**
- Governor loses his "fix-it" agent
- State loses operational flexibility
- Aelia's network becomes leaderless, fragments across competing factions
- Other agents (Cassius included) don't know how to operate without her guidance—State apparatus becomes less efficient

**If Spared (captured, shown mercy):**
- Aelia recognizes strength and makes new offer
- Act 3: She becomes possible ally IF you can convince her system is broken
- If you leverage her against Governor: She's useful operative, but she's playing you too
- Her betrayal could destabilize entire State apparatus
- OR: If she genuinely likes Cassian (rare, requires multiple charm checks), she might actually help—not for power, but for first time in life

### Investigation Clues

- **S34 (55%):** "Someone above VEIL is operating — probably Governor's personal agent"
- **Mid-Act 3 (75%):** "Aelia has resources beyond VEIL, direct access to Governor, plans that extend beyond current conflict"
- **Late Act 3 (90%):** "Aelia has been manipulating events from start — her influence is deep, her goals obscure"

### Relationship Score Progression

| Stage | Relationship | Context |
|---|---|---|
| Start of Act 2 | 0 (unknown) | Aelia watches from distance |
| S34 (if done) | +3 (accepted deal) or -2 (refused deal) | Direct approach |
| S34 (if avoided) | 0 (never met) | She remains shadow |
| Mid-Act 3 (if allied) | +1 to +4 | Depends on how well you work together |
| Mid-Act 3 (if opposed) | -2 to -4 | She's orchestrating against you |
| Act 3 final | Can range -5 to +5 | Based on power dynamics |

### Unique Mechanics

**Political Insider Knowledge:**
Aelia has dirt on everyone. If she becomes ally, she can provide intelligence on:
- Governor's secret movements and plans
- VEIL's hidden operations (she oversees them)
- State corruption specific enough to break system (if she chooses to reveal)
- Locations of Governor's secret resources

**Master Manipulator:**
Aelia is never at full vulnerability. Even if defeated, she's still playing a longer game. Even if allied, she's still considering how to benefit. She's the most dangerous rival because she doesn't need to defeat Cassian—she just needs to position herself correctly for what comes after Cassian.

**Arc Twist:**
Possible late-game twist: Aelia reveals that SHE was the one who arranged ledger's circulation. She planted it. It's not Cassian's secret—it's her weapon. She's been using Cassian to destabilize system so she can rebuild it under her control. Or she's been protecting Cassian from being hunted, using government resources to misdirect other hunters. Or both simultaneously.
