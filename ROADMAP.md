## ⚠️ Known Issues & Technical Debt

- **No character portrait art** — CardDisplay uses faction glyphs as placeholder; ready to swap in real art when available
- **Fallback enemy list remains** — Combat uses mission enemies first, but still has single-enemy fallback for safety when mission data is missing
- **Card effects not resolved** — Effect strings ("poison_1", "stun_2") display but don't execute (Phase 9 task)
- **Accessibility follow-through pending in all screens** — settings exist; some combat-specific contrast/palette tuning remains
- **CombatUI exceeds 1000 lines** — now includes UX systems; split into components (HUD/Hand/EnemyIntent/Log) is recommended

---

## 👥 Team & Roles

- **Godot Development:** Claude Code (direct file editing)
- **Code Review/Integration:** GitHub Actions CI, branch protection
- **Testing:** Automated test suite + manual playtesting
- **Content Design:** Data file tuning (missions, cards, enemies, lieutenants)
